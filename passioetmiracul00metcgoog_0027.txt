gelic precept, “Conrpelle intrare ut impleatur doinus nrea¹.‘” Again,
we are told that in North Vikcn Olaf Tryggvason inviter] all rnen to
receive Christianity‚ and that those who refused he killed, mutilated‚ or
banished2.

Not far froin Tunsberg he made a great feast, to which he in-
vited several notable warlocks (‘seithnren ’). Strong drink was supplied
without stint, and when they were all very drunk he ordered the house
to be seton lire, and all the people inside were burnt³. Here we
have the king again backed by Bishop Sigurd‚ his great supporter.
The corpus vile on this occasion was Raud‚ the great chief of Godo in
the Saltenljord. He positively declined to be baptized, and scoffed at
G0d; whereupon the king had him tied down on a weaver’s bearn, face

so it was that, when S. Olaf carne to the throne, Norway‚ nominally
Christian, was to all intents and purposes heathen, and he had to do
the work all over again ⁴.

Olaf Haraldson went to work pretty much in the same way as
Olaf Tryggvason. He would hear of no contradiction or delay. The
people of Trondhjem, as well as all his subjects, must leave their horse-

in fact present execution, maiming‚ exile, or, at the least, a fine.
Before long he extended his missionary operations to the South and
