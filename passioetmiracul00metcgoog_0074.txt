the remissiori os siu. Gaining strength with the effort, he insensibly prov
tracted his words into the usual sermon. Then hc went through the

2¹ office ol the mass, and through the whole solemnity. Instead ol being
‘¹ latigued by it, he lelt resreshed by the exertion, and although the

pain had not entirely disappeared, his bones were sully consolidated‚ and

⁴ by degrees he was perlectly cured. Now when was this miracle per·

formed? The Archbishop was in exile in England lor three years, he·
did not return till 1182, and died at the close ol 1187. Did his miraculous

preservation take place before or alter his absence? A true answer to '
this question would be our best gulde asto the probable date ol Eystein’s

literary productiori. Unlortunately the author has not sufficient data sor

arriving at a conclusion. One would have naturally imagincd that it

happened before his exile, when he was a younger man and more able

to mount to giddy heights than when age had rendered him less adven-

turous. But with a person ol the Archbishop's spirit and resolution,

this would perhaps make uo difference.

XX. Eystein’s church (or rather basilica), a great partos which
still exists‚ is thus described ¹. lt was dedicated to Christ. ln slrape
it was cruciform. The walls inside and out were beautifully sculptured.
Along the gilded Westem sront were colossal stone statues ol the twelve
Apostles, also gilt. Both inside and out there were rows of columns ol
black and white and other coloured marbles, all polished. Sixty of these
adorned the southern portico, which will give some idea os the cost ot' the
whole building. The bestnmarbles were from lreland and Greenland‚
while the soapstone came from the province ol Trondhjem. Quite in
keeping with the splendour of the edifice was the mass ol valuable objects
preserved in the sacristy‚ such as books, chalices‚ patens, vestments‚ and
other ecclesiastical utensils.r On stated occasions, as for instance on the
festival ol the Saluta vast concourse ol people thronged to Trondhjem.
Religious motives must doubtless have been at work with many of the
devotees thus assembled3 but that some ol the spectators, monks
among them, repaired hither lor anything but religion's sake is clear from
an incidental remark in the narrative ol a miracle (p. 85) which caused
an immense sensation in the religious world.
