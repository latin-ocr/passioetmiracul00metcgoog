After his death‚a wooden church was erected on the spot where his
body had lain buried for a year, in a sandbanlr, to the south, near the
river. ln place of this wooden church Olaf Kyrre built later a stone
church, called Christ Church, or Trinity Church. South of it, but per-
haps near to it, Harald Hardrada had already erected a large stone
choreb, called S. Mary’s. These two churcheS, Trinity 3ηά S. Mary's‚
thus stood close side by side of each other, till the time of Archbishop

Eystein. He had both taken down, and in the place of the first, he
erected the renowned and magnificent Christ Church (begun after 1161).
lt was enlarged under Archbishop Sigurd (from 1248), who added thc
grand west front, now in ruins. The entrance to the choir in which
the shrine of S. Olaf was placed nearly coincided with the spot where
once stood the high altar of S. Mary's Church¹.' (Munch Hister.-
geograph. Beskrr'oclse ocur Norge‚ p. 3 3.)

Eystein's motive in writing the legend would seem to have been
a mixed one. Deeply penetrated by an affection and admiration
for the man who had planted the cross in the Northern regions, and
had forced his countrymen out of a darh· and grovelling heathenism
into the light and elevation of the Christian creed, he only saw the
bright side of the shield‚-the holy zeal of the missionary, the high
object he had in view-and shut his eyes to his method of accomplish-
irlg the work. And so the task he sets before himself is to extol and
eulogize a martyr. But at the same time, to judge from the records of
the Archbishop’s life, he must have had a further object in view. Filled
with a conscientious‚ doubtless, but overweening and exaggerated notion
os the just claims and high position of the clergy, he was here, as in all
the active concerns of his life, benton magnilying his office, and increasing
the power of the hierarchy‚ though it might be by indirect means; while
a man of his worldly shrewdness would not be slow to perceive that the

Schbning's theories about the Cathedral and the site of S. Clement’s Church. S.
Clement, be it said, was a dedication much affected by Danish 3ηά Norwegian
