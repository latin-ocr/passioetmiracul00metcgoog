Tryggvason prepared and laid the foundations of Christianity, but
S. Olaf raised the walls. Olaf Tryggvason planted the vineyard, but
S. Olaf made the vine put forth its tendrils and produce fair fruit ¹.’

But perhaps it will not be antiss to cite, in reference to S. Olaf’s
character, the words of Haldor Bryniulsson, a sensible man and a great
chief. One day he heard people talking about S. Olaf and his half·
brother Harald Hardrada‚ and saying how unlike they were. ‘I was
very intimate with both the brothers‚' he put in, ‘and knew well the
dispositions of both, and I never knew men whose dispositions were
more alike. They were both men of the greatest sagacity and very
bold in arms3 greedy of power and property, imperious and not skilled
in winning popular favour, zealous of governing and severe in punishing.
King Olaf forced the people into Christianity and good customs, and
punished cruelly those who withstood him. This just and equal judg·
ment the chiefs of the country could not bear, but raised an army against
him, and killed him in his own kingdom. And for this he became a
saint. King Harald, on the other hand, marauded to obtain glory
and power, forced all the people he could under his mle, and died in
another king's dominions².’

Let us next observe what Snorri himself thought about the matter.
He tells us what were the three objects which Olaf Haraldson always
kept in view while he sat upon the throne :—

1. To protect the country from the foreigner.

2. To convert the people to the true faith.

3. To punish evil-doers and to establish law on a right basis ³.

Surely a king who at that time of day acted upon such principles
may well be called a righteous and conscientious ruler, and yet S. Olaf
has been looked upon by many as a mere bloodthirsty villain. Laing, for
instance, in his Nonvay, tells us that ‘King Olaf H araldson . . ‚appears to
have been the most bloodthirsty tyrant who was ever canonized’ (p. 52);
and again, ‘Never was a monarch opposed and cut off by his people on
juster grounds’ (ibid. 64) ⁴. The reason why Olaf cameto incur such an
