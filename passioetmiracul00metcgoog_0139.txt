were heard; the rocks collapsecl and blockcd up the entrance. When the pagan
adherents of Hacon arrived they could lind nothing, and returned home in amate·
ment. Some time aiter, when, on the death ol Hacon Jarl, King Olal Tryggvason
succeeded to the throne os N orway, two Norwegians, both named Thord, approach·
ing the island, perceived in the air a wonderful light, and upon landing, discovered
a human head srom which emanated a delightlul odour. They at once started with
the head for the court of the king ; a consultation was held over it by the king and
his English Bishop Sigurd, who at once repaired to the island, and under the
guidance ot' a pensant, who had seen a heavenly light playing over a certain spot,
discovered the rocks fallen at the entrance of the cave, on the removal of which the
bones ol Sunniva and her friends were found. Two churches were at once erected
in Selja and dedicated respectively to S. Sunniva¹ and S. Alban, to the latter ol whom
the head was said to belong. A remarkable conjunction! ln 1170 the relies ol
Sunniva were brought srom Selja to Bergen by Bishop Paul, Chaplain to king Eystein,
and were placed in the Cathedral there; and Sunniva and Alban came to be re·
garded as the proto-martyrs of Norway. Whence this legend came to Norway
would best appear if the nationality of the saint could be settled. Professor Bugge
is os opinion that the name is the northern sorm ol the Frankish name Sunnoveila.
On the other hand, lvar Aasen has called attention to its resemblance to many old
English names, e. g. Brihteva, Edeva, Godeva, Leveva, and Alfilal. But the very
same name occurs in England, e. g. Sonneva, a woman os York, in the Conqueror's
day ³, and Sunieve a poor woman at Edgeworth⁴, in the middle of the twelfth cen-
tury. Besides which, Olaf Tryggvason, who first gave countenance to the miracle,
was baptized in England, while his Bishop Sigurd was a born Englishmanl. So
that it is not unreasonable to suppose the Sunniva legend to have come from Eng-
land and the more so, as itis mixed up with S. Alban, an Englishman, while, as
the reader will perceive, there is an echo about it os the tale os S. Ursula
