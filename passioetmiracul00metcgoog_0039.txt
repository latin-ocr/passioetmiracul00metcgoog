sly gravitr, “hlany bellererl that tllaf must be a Saiut, eren among
those who had persecuted him with the greatest animosity¹.’ Under
the auspices of the nobles, with Einar Tambarskeluer at their head, a
complete revulsion of popular feeling ensucd ². Some of the late king's

chief foes found the country too hot to hold them. Bishop Sigurd‚ for
instance, who had been especially violent against his patron, found it
advisable to go over to England to King Canute ³. A messenger was at
once despatched to the Uplands to fetch Olaf's favourite friend and
adviser, Bishop Grimkel. Grimkel carne, had an audience with the
alien King Swend‚ and his mother Alfifa, and on his alleging that
certain miracles had been effected by the deceased Olaf-notably‚ that

a blind man had been enred through touching the water in which his f

corpse had been washed-he obtained permission to disinter‘the body.
This had been secretly placed in a coffin by faithful friends soon after the
battle. It was thcn carried down the F jord in a small boat, and buried
in a sandhill at the capital. On proceeding to dig for the body, it was
found that the occupation of the diggers was pretty nigh forestalled‚ for
the coffin had already raised itself almost to the surface of the earth.
Moreover it appeared quite new, and on opening it a delightful and
fresh smell arose from it. The cheeks were red, as if the king were
asleep‚ while his hair and nails had grown as much as if he had lived on
earth since his fall. King Swend and his mother Alfifa came to see the
wondrous sight. A remarkable colloquy then took place. The queen·
mother saw what was at stake. Make the late king a saint, and goodbye
to the throne of Norwayl So she dryly remarked, ‘ People buried in sand
rot very slowly. It would not have been so if he had been buried in
mould! Afterwards the bishop took scissors and clipped the king’s hair
and beard. ‘See‚’ cried he, ‘how the hair and beard have grown.'
