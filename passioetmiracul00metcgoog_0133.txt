arrarum 11. 119

heasts to be devoured by them, but in vain, at last commanded him to he stoned,
and when they had laid a heap of stones on him and thought he was dead, on a
sudden the martyr of Christ, in everybody’s hearing, prayed to the Lord that he
would take away his soul in peace, and presently gave up the ghost. His body was
buried in that city in a new coffin, 14 Kal. Decemb. lt is to this last that Newcourt¹

would assign the dedication of the church at the foot of London Bridge. But it does
not seem improbable, in the absence of all documents with regard to its dedication,
looking to the number of churches close by in the City of London dedicated to
the other great Scandinavian saint, S. Olaf, that the lllagnus of the dedication is
not the martyr of the third century, but an Orkney Earl, lllagnus Erlendson, who
was canonized after his murder. His biography and death are recorded in the
Orkney Saga², and in the fuller account in the Saga of S. Magnus, which are
borne out as regards the historical facts by the Heimskringla. The Magnus Helga
Saga, a complex work, derived from Norse and Latin sources, follows in substance the
Latin biography of one Rodbert, a monk (c. 6), whom it quotes and who wrote in 1130,
in the days of Earl Rognwald, and who himself cites as his authority the narration of
a man who was present at the murder of S. Magnus, and related the particulars to the
writer (Magnus Saga 22). lt must be especially noted as indicative of the particular
Magnus to whom the London church was dedicated, that the church of S. Olafoccupies
the corresponding position just below the bridge, on the opposite side of the Thames;
so that at the time, nay, probably before, the first stone bridge was built, the ends
of the wooden bridge were occupied by the churches of S. Olaf and S. Magnus
respectively. Such a juxtaposition was quite natural, as in the old Norse Saga we
find persons ³ in distress offering prayers to these two saints simultaneously. According
to stow, Peter of Colechurch began to build the bridge of stone about the year 1176,
and it was finished in 1203, when a chapel was built on the arches, dedicated to
S. Thomas the Martyr, which chapel was within the precincts of S. Magnus’ parish.
This points to a very early period for the existence of S. Magnus' Church, in fact, at
the very time when the cult of S. Magnus would be at its height. ln this church of
S. Magnus, Hugh Pourt, Sheriff of London in 1302, and Margaret his wife, founded
a perpetual chantry (Newcourt, l. 396).

. But it is time that we should say a few words about theman to whom the
London and other churches seem unquestionably to be dedicated Orkney was first
christianized by king Olaf Tryggvason of N orway. ln the reign of Magnus Barefoot,
S. Magnus first comes into prominence. That king had carried him off in a Viking
