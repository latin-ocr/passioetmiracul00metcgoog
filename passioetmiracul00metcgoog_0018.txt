4 INTRODCCYION.

the solitude 01 Kone-ljord was too much 101 him. liach time he behold
the ll'estern sun setting in the Fjord, he was remindcd 01 his beloved
valley in Yorkshire‚ and longed to rejoin his old friends So, alter
many years' residence among the Northern barbariam, having placed
the affairs 01 the new monastery on a sure basis, hc returned to
Fountains, and died at a great age, and was buried there. The inter·
course with England continued, and the Abbots traded thither in their
own vesselS, enjoying special privileges. Thus King John, in a docu-
ment dated Pontelract, August 30, 1212, exempted the Abbot’s ship
from the payment 01 all imposts in English ports; Rotuli liter. patent.

man‚’ was sent to King Henry ΙΙΙ, then a minor, to conclude a treaty
01 sriendship and commerce with England‚ where he remained over
the winter (Rymer‚ Foedera, ed. 1704, 1. 2233 hlunch’s Hist. Narro.
iii. 741). Abbot Richard, who was employed by our King Edwardl
in delicate negotiations, and who witnessed the marriage 01 King Eric
and Margaret 01 Scotland at Bergen, in 1283, was an Englishman.
The end 01 a subsequent Abbot, Arne by name, was a tragical one.
ln 1336 or 1337 he sailed to England‚ and was seized by English
Duggars, who cut 011 the heads os himself and all his crew‚ and threw
their bodies overboard ¹.

We have been thus particular about the Norwegian offshoot from the
English Abbey, because it has been suggested that the volume covered

the crew 01 such a vessel. Ib. 388, we find that thirty 01 these craft reached leeland,

The pedigree 01 those hardy sellows who leave our shores 101 many weelrs in pursuit
01 their dangerous calling is thus a pretty long one. There were Duggars and
Duggars. These visitors to North lceland seized cattle, it is true, but lest money
in payment.
