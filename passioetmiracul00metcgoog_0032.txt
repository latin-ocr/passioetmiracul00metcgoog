be able to recover his lost kingdom. Their master, however, despairing
of regaining his throne, resolved in his own mind to turn monk, and go to
jerusalem. It was at this juncture that king Olaf Tryggvason appeared
to him in a dream, counselling him to regain his kingdom, or perish in the
attempt. Nay, when he awoke he fancied he could see the shoulders of
a man retiring from the apartment, being no other than his ghostly
visitor. Accepting the omen, in spite of the remonstrances of his good
friends, King Jarislelf and Queen Ingigerd, he started for Norway, and
crossed the Baltic to the isle of Gotland, where he arrived justin time
to hear the good news that Earl Hacon‚ who had been to England to
fetch his English bride, had been lost in Pentland Frith on his way home¹,
and that Norway was without a head. Against the advice of his
friends in Norway, he prosecuted his advance thither across Sweden,
and on his arrival in Vaerdale, at the head of the Trondhjemljord, mus-

was girded his sword called Hneitir, the hilt ol which was of gold, and the

of that luckless day is well known. One of the rebellious bonders smote
the king with his axe below the knee, upon which he sank on a stone

praying to God. Kalf wounded him on the left side of the neck; while , ’
Thorir Hund drove his spear under the coat of mail into his bowels. A
great slaughter of the king’s adherents and a general rout followed.
Thorir Hund himself was filled with sudden remofse when he saw Olaf
lifting up his eyes to heaven. He had received a wound in the
hand, and the martyr’s blood ran down his spear and healed the wound,
leaving a thread-like scar only. Thorir proceeded to England to tell
this astonishing piece of news to his principal, Canute. The king was

greatly cast down; and, on Thorir asking him the reason, ‘Ahl' said he, ‘I
