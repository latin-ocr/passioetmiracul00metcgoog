INTRODI'CTION. 51

admission into Paradise‚ even before their blood grew cold ¹, to which
Swerrir makes a telling allusion in his ironical speech over the grave
os Jarl Erling; while against ‘the apostate’ Swerrir, ‘the renegade
priest‚' ‘the impost0r‚' ‘the wizard in league with the Devil‚’ Arch-
bishop Eystein, seconding the Pope, fulminated anathemas without end.
On Swerrir routing king Magnus and the Royalists at the battle of
Ilevold‚ and thus planting a soot on the steps ol the throne, Eystein,
rather than sanction his usurpation by being present at the coronation‚
fled to England, whence he lost no time in issuing an excommunica·
tion against Swerrir. Indeed sor a Norse ecclesiastic to be present at, or
absent from, the ceremony was equally sraught with danger. Il he re·
lused, he was liable‚ as was reported of one os the recalcitrant bishops
on this occasion, to be chained up to his lips in the sea till he consented23
while on the other hand, Pope Alexander III excommunicated all the
bishops who were present at the coronation. According to Sver‘ris
Saga (68 [78])‚ the Archbishop spent three years in England, returning
to Norway1182(An72.Isl.). lt is lrom his inspiration doubtless that
the English chroniclers drew their pictures of Swerrir. Although his
cause was at a later period espoused by our king John, who in 1201 sent
him troops, Ribballdar, to aid him against the Baglar ( S verris Saga, 174
[194]), Hoveden describes Swerrir asa usurpet and murderer3 while
William of Newburgh (i. 272-276‚ ed. T. Hearne‚ Oxon, 1719) calls him
‘Diaboli vas proprium‚' ‘Virga luroris domini’ and ‘nefandus presbyter!
He further says, ‘Ab Archiepiscopo terrae illius solemniter coronari

¹ ‘Archbishop Turpin, above the rest,
Spurred his steed to a jutting erest,
His sermon thus to the Franks he spake :-

l will assoil you, your souls to heal,
ln death ye are all holy martyrs crowned.’

And again-
‘Soldiers and lieges ol God are ye,
And in Paradise shall your guerdon be,
To lie on its holy flowerets fair!
