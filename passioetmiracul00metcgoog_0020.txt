that parent treatise‚ which learned critics have insisted must be the
'groundwork of the various scattered notices of the Passion and Miracles

miracles are here recorded, and who in the national mind has eclipsedl

attributed to the fact that, directly after his death,a careful and com-
plete oral account of his life was put together by some contemporary
and well-informed Sagaman3 and preserved by tradition, whole and
intact, until it was committed to writing either at the instance of Are
Frodi, or by that author himself. The basis of the account would of
course be the verseso fthe King’s scalds, relating his exploits Such

sagas than can be ascribed to these scalds.

Norway effected by him in so short a space, were things that would
imprint themselves deeply on the popular imagination; but they might,

indistinct, but for the hand of wise and skilful chroniclers to give them
form, coherence, and permanency. The following are histories of S.
