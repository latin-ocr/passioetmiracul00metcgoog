ltfl‘ltom 'C Tlon'.

. . Saint olaf, who on Gotl relieel,
Three days the first his horne descried.

. Harald so fierce with anger burn'd‚
He into a loathly dragon turn'd.

. A pious zeal Saint Olaf bore,
And so the crown of Norway wore.

. And now to church Saint Olaf went
Humbly¹ his heartfelt thanks to vent:

. And while he round the churchyard paced,
His strearn'ing hair a glory graced.

. Whorn God assists will win their aini,
Their foes win naught but grief and shame.
At T rondtjcm so pleasant it is lo rest!

This ballad is full os ideal beauty. The calm sels-possession of
the Saint and the rashness of Harald the Stern are well contrasted.
Olafs piety in going to church before setting out on the voyage is
characteristic of the Saint. But see an anecdote in our legend, p. 82.

It was no ordinary poet who could describe the swiftness of the
vessel as such that an arrow shot from it was overtaken in its ssight,
and fell upon the deck, or even in the water abaf .

This legend, though, as Grimm has observed, it is not recorded in
any of the bona fide old Chronicles, may have arisen from the fabled
exploit of Olaf cuttingthrough the neck of land which lay between the
Maelar lake and the Baltic, and thus escaping with his ships from the
pursuing Swedes ¹. But in this narration the god Thor and his exploits
against the ‘Hill-folk' are looming in the distance.

The goblintale is told somewhat differently in ‘Trollini i Horna·
londum²,' an old ditty of the Faroes. The ballad runs to the length
of sixty=seven stanzas in the solt Faroese dialect. Thegist olitis
as follows. King Olaf sails in ‘The Serpent' along the coast northwards.
He suffers much in dreams on account of the heathens in that quarter.
He summons them all to a Thing; and bids thern accept Christianity.
Some do s0, others fly to desert places afar off, or hide in caves. The

king wishes to see the ugly Troll who rules over the rest. Thorstein
Strong-as-an-Ox says, his name is Arint Bunkebjbrn3 he takes ships,
