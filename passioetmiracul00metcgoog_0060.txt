46 INTRODC'CTION.

D. Olai, ut volunt, nihil minus quarn arcus fuit: scd lapis est, ac fuit
semper in hanc formam a natura elaboratus! The Norwegian rustics
had found a stone shaped exactly like a bow. This must be the great
Saint’s handiworlr, thought they, and it uvas accordingly sent to Denmark
as a curiosity of the first magnitude. Sooth to say, S. Olafs arrow also
existed in Norway, but it was too large to pack up and send to Copen-
hagen. The traveller in Store·Standdal, Sondmdr, will see a long
crooked column of stone, lying in a right line with a hole in aneigh·
bouring mountain. This stone is ¹ S. Olaf s arrow,' which the Saint shot

with such force that it went right through the mountain, and so made
the hole.

XVI. We now come to the extant literary monuments concerning
the martyrdom and miracles of S. Olaf. As a whole, these are presented
imperfectly in Latin. They are as follows, and are exhibited in the
following list by Professor Storm‚ in his recent learned and ingenious
work on the ancient historic monuments of his country l:—

1. The Bollandists' Acta Sanctorum, vol vii, p. 87, for the month os July.

2. Breviorium lt‘r'drosierrse, Paris, 15¹9} printed in Langebelr’s Scriptores renem
Hernicorum, ii. 539-52‚ and better in More lecit. Norv. p. 229-245.

3. Breucorimrr Scarcnse, Nuremberg, 1493 <Storm‚ 2 51-2 54).

4. Breviorium Lincoperrse, Nuremberg, 1498 ; and Breo. Arlrusiense, AarhuS, 1519
(Storm‚ 247·²51)·

5. Τὴε following Swedish and Danish breviaries are mutually related to each
other z-Brev. Scregusme, Stockholnr, 1495; Brev. Upsalense, Stockholm,
1496; Brev.Aros1'errse‚Basel,1513; Brev. Otileoniense, Ltibeclc, 1483 and
1496; Breo. Roschildcnse, Paris, 1517 Brev. Lurrdense‚ Paris, 1517 Brev
sleswicense Paris, 1 512

The first two of these are identical with the Brcv Aroseense (Storm‚ 2 5 ς 2⁶5)-

ι These Breviaries, although nearly related, are derived from different older manu·

scnpt sources.
