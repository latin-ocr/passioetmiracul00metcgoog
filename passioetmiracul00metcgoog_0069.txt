dnly on these matters. llccnrcls ol Becket's lile and miracles would be
in the monasteries where Eystein was entertaincd3 what if lre had a
hand in making them known to his own countrymen? Surely this is a
very natural and reasonable supposition, although we arc without proos os
its correctness. There are, as most os our readers are aware, a N orwegian
and also an Icelandie free version ol the lile of Thomas Becketl from
the Latin biography composed in England. The oldest ol these re-
censions, the Icelandie one, dated hom the first hall ol the thirteenth
century, that is to say, a very short time aster Eystein's residence in
England. lt seems to the present writer more than probable that,
although he was not the author ol these extant bookS, yet he had
a great deal to do with them indirectly. Would he not hasten to make
known to his countrymen the earlier accounts ol Becket on which the
well-known Quadrilogus was founded?

XIX.· But with all his persistent fighting sor the pomp and power
of the Church the Arehbishop was a man os liberal views in other
matters Greatly to his credit be it observed that, while ever working
lor the temporal well-being of his see, the lolty churchman did not

lorget the material interests os the humbler classes ol his countrymen.
Thus he obtained lrom Pope Alexander Ill a removal ol some of
the ecclesiastical restrictions on herring fishing. From cap. 26 in the
old Frostathing’s Church law ², or Canons and decrees of the Church
authorities, of which the Archbishop was the author, weascertain the

lact, interesting alike from an economieal and a spiritual point of view,
that sor the future, whenever the herting was off the land, the fishing
might be prosecuted every day, Sundays included, with the exception os
certain dayS, twenty-seven in number, therein specified, one of which

was S. Olars day ³.
