INTRODUCTION.

. The lively Dragon thou shalt take,

And 1 with the Ox my voyage make.

. But first we both to church will go,

Before we either sail or rowJ'

. As otas through the churchyard strode,

Like golden thread his tresses glow’d.

. A message came in haste to say,

“Thy brother Harald sails away.’¹

. “So let them sail, is sail they will,

To God’s word we will listen stilt

. But while at Mass 1 hear His word,

Go ye, and water take on board.”

. “We go to table, eat our meal‚

And hasten then to launch our keel.”

. “They took their meal, and sought the strand,

Where lay the tardy Ox at land;

. And water, anchor, rope and oar

They quickly aboard their vessel bore.'’ Δ

. Saint Olas sat on the ship’s prow;

“ Now, Ox, in name of Jesus go.”

. Saint orat seized his long white horn;
“Now go, as it in fields of corn.'’

. Such strides the Ox began to make,

That high with billows foam’d the wake.

. “ See, thou who sittest on the mast,

Is Harald’s ship we are catching sast.'’

. “For all the world naught else 1 see,
Thau just the top os a losty tree.

. And now 1 see near Norway’s‘ land

A silken sailuwith golden band.

'. And now where Norway's shoals must lie,
1 see the Dragon’s mainsail fly. Ἰ

. 1 see just under Norway’s side,
Wrth rapid leaps the Dragon stride”

.’ Α hlow on the Ox’s rihs he gave;
“Put out thy strength and dance the wave.”
