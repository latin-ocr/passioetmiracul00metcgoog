20 INTRODUCTION.

Asa reward for his verse, the king gave Sigvat a gold ring that
weighed halfa mark, made him one of his sixty court retainers, and
presented him with a sword (Heimskringlm c. 41). Later on the
king's views about scalds seem to have become modified3 for he not
only tolerated Sigvat’s and other scalds' verses in his presence, but also
composed poetry himself. Some of his compositions are to be found
in the Saga. One of these, in ten stanzas, commemorates his con-
quest of London (Fornmanna Sogur, v. 227). Sigvat was away on a
pilgrimage to Rome by Olaf’s leave at the time of the king's death.
The tidings of it reached him in the South. Soon after he passed by
a village and heard a husband wailing grievously over the loss of his
wife, striking his breast, tearing his clothes, and weeping and saying
he wished to die; and Sigvat sang-

‘This poor man mourns a much-loved wife,
Gladly would he be quit of life,

But the brave man who knows no fear
Drops for his king a silent tear,

And feels perhaps his loss as deep

A's 'those who clamour when they weep¹.'

Sigvat had once been petted by Canute, and he was now on Olafs
death invited to the court at Trondhjem by Canute’s son. Swend, who
was proclaimed king on the fall of Olas; but he retired to his home.
Here he would express his seelings thus-

‘While Olaf lived how smiled the land!
Mountain and cliff and pebbly strand.
All Norway then, sofresh, so gay,

On land or sea, where oft 1 lay3
But now to me all seems so dreary,
All bleak and dull-of life l’m weary¹.'

A touch of pathos in a rude and savage age, which makes* us feel
that in those times men were not so unlike us after all. We have
described Olaf Haraldson’s cruelties to his subjects in forcing Chris·

¹ Saga Magnus Goliam (Heimskr. p. 521).
² Sigvat was as true3toKing Magnus as he had been to his father the Saint. When
the new king was commencing his reign with violence, and alienating the bonders,

’ Sigvat performed the office of a candid friend, addressed him in his ‘F ree speaking

Song‚’ and thereby saved the kingdom. Heimskr. p. 526.
