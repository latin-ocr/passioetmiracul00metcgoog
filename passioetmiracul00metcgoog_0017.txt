One offshoot from the Abbey of Fountains is very interesting in
connexion with our present subject. ln 1146, ie. fourtcen years after its
foundation, Sigurd, Bishop of Bergen in Norway, being in England‚
visited Fountains Abbey, where he was so struck with a mode of religi·
ous life such as he had not before witnessed that he begged the Abbot,
Henry Murdac, to furnish him with the means of establishing a Cis·
tercian cell in his own country. After discussing the matter with his

monks, Murdac acceded to the proposal, and thirteen associated brethren,
the same number that had founded Fountains, under the leadership of
Ranulf as their Abbot, departed from their Yorkshire home on July 10,
1146. Their patron, the Bishop, provided them with a home at Lysa,
in the bottom of Lysa-fiord a branch of the Kors-ijord, some twenty
miles south of Bergen ¹. This place is remarkable as being the only
Norse Monastery the history of whose foundation is preserved; and
that by means of a document published in England2. The brethren
speedily built for themselves a church and ‘monastic buildings the ruins
of which are still extant, and are sufficient to indicate their noble
character and dimensione After the Reformation, much oi the best
masonry‚ as is known from Royal Letters, was removed from time to
time to Bergen, Copenhagen, and even to distant Mechlenburg ³.

Ranulf‚ the first Abbot of Lysa, is said to have been a God-fearing ,
man, and to have been iavoured with visions and revelations4. But

Kirkestall from the dictation of Serlo: in his Memart'als as Fauntains Abbey
(Sunees Society, No. 42), vol. i, p. 89, Walbran observes-‘ The singularly beautiful
aud appropriate name of Lisa-lys signifying “ light ” in the N orwegian language-
may perhaps have emanated originally from the poetical mind of S. Bemard ; for, in
1127, a colony of monks went out from Clairvaux, and founded an Abbey iu Spain,
which was also called Vallis Lucentis, S. Bern. Opp. Omn. (ed. Mabillon), vol. i, col.

in Spain but in F rance. The monks did not go from Clairvaux, but from the Mon·
astery of Prully, in the Diocese of Sens, as Bemard suggested to its Abbot, Artaldus.
The leader of the new colony was Norpaldus. The French name of his Monastery
was Vauluisant. It is near Seus3 Gall. Chr. xii. 215, 231. The charter is printed iu
