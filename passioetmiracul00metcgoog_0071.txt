interview. Eystein died on January 26, 1188, altor having been sor
twenty-seven years Metropolitan os Norway, and was buried in the
sacristy os Christ Church. As bishop and statesman‚ he must be re·
garded as one ol the most gifted and remarkable personages recorded
,in Norwegian Annals. Nay, he could lor that matter have held his
own with some ol the most notable clergy mentioned by historians.
In recognition os his great services he was, in 1229¹, proclaimed Saint by
law; and there is a letter os Pope Gregory IX, April 2ο, 2242, ordering
due inquiry to be made as to his alleged miracles with a view to
decreeing to him the honours ol canonization2. We have seen the Arch-
bishop as he appeared to Papal eyes.

The reader will perhaps like to hear the verdict passed upon Eystein
by Torlaeus (Historia Norwegica, Part ΙΙΙ. c. v.). He there cites the
second chapter of the old Gulathing's law, which was the law lor the
West ol N orway, as the Frostathing’s law was lor the province ol Trond·
hjem, and which ordains ‘ de electione regis haerede deficiente‚’ as sollows:
All the bishops and abbots, etc. are spontaneously to repair to Nidaros
in the same month that they hear oi the king’s death. The crown ol
the defunct monarch is then to be offered up'lor the good of his soul;
and is to hang in the Cathedral sor ever to the glory os God and S.
Olal, as Magnus appointed, who was the first crowned king os Norway3
any person who transgresses this law to be under the ban of God, the
Pope, and the hierarchy. Torlaeus' comments hereupon are forcible:
‘Hic primus Archiepiscopatus in Norwegia instituti fructus. Regni
enim usum, veterator hic sub sacris induviis, vulpes simulac rapax
lupus, jure haereditatis antiquato justisque haeredibus erept0‚ vendidit,
sibique et suis successoribus illud pariter ac reges in perpetuum subdere
conatus, materiam litium caediumque uberrimam reliquit' But then
Torsaeus was reputed to be descended lrom the blood royal os Nor-
way, and was moreover historiographer to his maJesty oi Denmark.

Hitherto then this man was known to history as the high-handed
desendet of the hierarchy, as the corrector ol morals alike in Norway
and Iceland³, asa maker ol laws and builder ol churcheS, as an ener-

getic partisan, as a statesman, and lastly as one who so manipulated
matters as 'to compel the king to accept the crown srom God and S.
