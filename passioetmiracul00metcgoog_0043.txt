throne he had a shrine made in shape and size like a coffin, mounted
with gold and studded with jewelS, and in sront there were padloeks
with keys, which the King kept in his custody¹. Into this shrine, which
weighed more than 3000 oz. ol silver, he put Olat⁵s remains. Each
month he had the hair and nails clipped. A law was passed making
the day of S. Olaf s death a festival sor ever. The shrine was visited
by pilgrims from distant nations ², and was a source os great wealth to
Trondhjem Cathedra13. On grand occasions, as on S. Olar s day and at
the election os a king, it was carried in procession ⁴.

According to Clzron. Matutine, 1098 (ed. P. A. Munch), Magnus
Barefoot, or BarelegS,—so called by his subjects because he adopted the
kilt during his six years‘ stay in the West,—was seized with a desire
to open the romb os S. Olal. The bishop and clergy resisted3 but
he ordered the shrine to be opened by soree. Alter beholding and
touching the body, which was incorrupt‚ he was struck with a sudden
panic, and lest the place wtth what haste he could. The next night
S· Olas appeared to him, and said, ‘Choose one os two things: either
to lose your lile and kingdom within thirty days, or to depart from
Norway‚ and never to see it again' He immediately sailed sor the
Orkneys, with a fleet of a hundred and sixty ships. Alter subjugating
these, with the rest of the Western Isles, he came to Man. He next
made an exploring voyage to Ireland, where he was surprised and
killed, and was buried at S. Patrick's Church in Down. ‘The Chronicle,
however,' says Munch, ‘errs in making the king salt in 1098, as this did
not occur till 1103, on his second expedition, as recorded by Ordericus
Vitalis. Nor is the motive assigned for his Western enterprise the
true one. It may have been a tradition in the Isle os Man, but this
tradition seems to have been derived from what is told in the Saga of
the grandfather of this King Magnus, Harald Hardrada, who on the
