result ol the publication ol such a work-first, probably, asa homily
in the vernacular (pp. 97 and 115, ‘ audientem' and ‘dilectissimi iratres'),
in the Cathedral church on S. Olas's day; and, secondly, as a book
in the Latin tongue, to be copied and sent to the monasteries abroad-
would attract sresh bands os pilgrims srom all parts to the martyr's
shrine, and replenish the coffers ol the Cathedral clergy ¹. And, sooth to
say, great sums os money would be needed to make up lor the constant
drain entailed upon them by the erection ol this vast edilice². Inci-
dentally in the latter part of the work, where Eystein gives an account of
his own personal experiences ol the Saint's powers, interesting details,
as we have seen, are blended with the thaumaturgic element, throwing
light upon the condition os society in his days, its mode of thought, its
state of culture, and a variety ol ordinary pursuits and callings. Lastly‚
he removes all doubt as to the high sanction under which the book
is given to the world.

² Archbishop Sigurd (1231-1252), the builder of the nave, procured the institution
in the kingdom ol a yearly payment ol one penny sor every head ol cattle, twothirds
ol which went to the Cathedral of Trondhjem under the name of Olasskot, and one-
third, called Hallvardskot‚ to the Cathedral os S. Hallvard at Oslo. This new pay-
ment, undertaken by the people and recommended by King Hacon, shows that the
construction os Nidaros Cathedral was regarded as a national enterprise. This
glorious pile is being successfully restored under the architeet, Mr. Christie.
