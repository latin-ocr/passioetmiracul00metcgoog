With reference to 1110 churches 10 London itself, we find an interest-
ing anecdotc related by Snorri (11.1). 1030) ¹. ‘In Valland (ie. the North-
west of France) there was a cripple, so infirm that he went upon knees
and knucldes. One day he fell asleep by the way side, when he dreamt
that a man of worshipful mien came to him and asked him whither
he was going. He mentioned a certain abode. The worshipful man
said to him, “Go to Olafs Church in London, and there you will be
cured.” On awaking he set 011 10 questos Olaf's Church. At length
he cameto London Bridge, and asked the citizens 11 they could tell
him where Olaf s Church was. And they answered and said, there were
many more churches than that they could tell to whom they were dedi-
cated. A little later a man came to him, and aslred where he was going.
He answered to him and said that he would fare to Olaf s Church.
The other said, “We will both fare together to Olafs Church, for 1
know the way thither. After this they fared over the Bridge, 000
along that street that led towards 01015 Church2. When they came
to the churchyard gate, the other strode over the threshold. But the
cripple rolled himself over it, and at once rose up whole. And when
he looked round, his companion had vanished.’

Snorrl, however, as before hinted, made quite 00 arbitrary arrange-
ment 01 1110 miracles, placing them in the various Kings’ Sagas. Thus
he appropriates to Magnus the Good and Harald Hardrada’s time

as the miracle 01 1110 French cripple just given. To Olaf Kyrre's time
