gilded helmet on his head, and mounted his horse3 3ηά when he saw the
banners of Olaf advancing, hc went out to meet him with a hundred men
all well equipped. People were gathered on the housetops to see the
sight. King Sigurd immediately saluted his step-son in a friendly way,
and invited him and his men to come in 3ηά take a friendly cup with
him. Aasta‚ on the contrary, went up 3ηά kissed her son, 3ηά invited
him to stay with her! Long was the discussion between the fiery Olaf
and his sober calculating relative. ‘He had such odds to encounter.
There was Olaf the Swedish king, who laid claim to our hero’s heritage,
3ηά Canute king of both Denmark 3ηά England, and, besides that,
there was Swend the other Danish Earl, the man in possession for
Canute. He, Sigurd Syr, really could make no promise of help till he
had conferred with the other upland kings. Very likely the common
people would side with him. They loved novelty. They did so when
Olaf Tryggvason arrived; they received him with rejoicing, but he did
not live long to enjoy the kingdom' Thus reasoned the prudence of
the Senior. Here the mother interposed: ‘I am rejoiced to see you, my
son. You shall have from me all the help Ican give. I’d rather you
were over-king in Norway, even though it were no longer than Olaf
Tryggvasou was, than that you should be no more of a king than
Sigurd Syr there, 3ηά die the death of old age! In the end, the upland
kings determined to support Olaf‘s cause. Doubtless his mother had a
principal hand in urging on her spouse to action. Olaf now marched
northward 3ηά succeeded in overcoming the opposition of the bonders
of the Trondhjem district. But there were the Earl Swend, and his
right-hand man, the great Einar Tambarskelver, to settle with. This
Ι he did effectually at the sea fight of Nessie, leading the attack in his
'j stout warship ‘The Qarl's Head,’ so called after Charlemagne, whose
² name he greatly venerated. Earl Swend fled first to Sweden, where
he got a promise of help to reconquer Norway from his brother-in-law
the Swedish king Olaf ; but soon after fell ill of a sickness which proved
fatal, on which Trondhjem' declared for Olaf. The game was practically
won, 3ηά he succeeded in obtaining the crown n.1).1015¹.

Olaf now built himself a palace at Nidaros, and surrounded him·
self with 311 the pomp and circumstance that became a king. Snorri
