expedition along the coast of Walcs, and in a battle off Anglesea he refused to light,
whereupon he was apostrophized by Barefoot, ‘Then go down, coward, into the holdl'
S. Magnus took his Psalter and obeyed, calmly chanting psalms while the battle
raged on the poop ¹. Some time after, Magnus escaped from durance by casting
himself overboard in a Scotch creek, and swimming to shore. As soon as the king
became aware of his ssight, he sent sleuth·h0unds in pursuit‚ which easily tracked the
fugitive, as he had wounded his foot against a stone. The leading hound came to

the foot of a tree which hlagnus had ascended, and began circling round it, baying
lustily withal Hurling a cudgel which he happened to have with him at the clamorous
beast, Magnus managed to wound him in the side 3 whereupon he fied with his tail
between his legs, and the rest of the pack taking fright scampered olf to the ship².
Not until the Viking deet had disappeared did Magnus venture to quit his place of
concealment in the woods; then he escaped to Scotland and remained for a time at
the court of king Malcolm ⁸. He also visited England, and was domiciled for a time
with a certain bishop in Wates. The uses of adversity were sweet to him. During
his exile, partly perhaps through the counsel of the bishop‚ he repented of his
past way of life, and from a sinner became a saintly character. Shortly after the
death of king Magnus Barefoot, he returned to Orkney from Scotland with a large
body of followers, to claim his hereditary rights to the suzerainty ol the country
against his cousin Hacon, Paul’s son, who hadobtained the title of Earl of Orkney
from the Norwegian king⁴. A compromise was effected‚ and the Orkneys were
divided between the two. For some years they remained on good terms, each
goi-eming his respective earldom in peace. But Magnus’ virtues, which rendered
him beloved by his subjects, provoked the jealousy of Hac0n; and there were not
wanting those who, perceiving this, so managed matters that a rupture was in the end
brought about, and the Earl resolved to extinguish his co-regent³. The popularity
of Magnus, however, made it difficult to effect this, except by treachery. So in
the year 1115 Hacon enticed him to the little island called Egilsey, under the pretence
of making a solemn covenant of peace ⁸. Magnus, in spite of inauspicious omens,
allowed himself to fall into the trap. With a few retainers he arrived at the place of
rendcevous, and repaired to the church ⁷, which was presently surrounded by Hacon

we must conjectanti to have been the first of the few on the thinly inhabited isle-group. The
