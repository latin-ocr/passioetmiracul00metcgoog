INTRODUCTION. 5

with scal-sitin may be a rnemorial ol the connexion between the two
AbbeyS‚ and that the animal whose skin has effectually protected the
volume may have disported itsell in Lysa-ljord many hundred years
ag03 a conjecture which, however, seems untenablesifi as is undoubtedly
the lact, the writing inside was, on the sace oi it, executed in England.
But one portion of its contentS‚ at all events-viz. the Passion and
Miracles of S. Olaf, which is here first published in its complete form-
may be due to the connexion between the English and Norwegian
¹·soundations. 11 Ranull returned to England before Eystein compiled
and wrote the supplementary chapters to the Passion of S. olaf, then
may not the book possibly have been carried to England by one os
the Abbots or ecclesiastics who were constantly repairing thither?
Or perhaps the writer himself, Archbishop Eystein, who was an exile
in England1, and was entertained at Bury S. Edmunds from August 9,
1181, to February, 1182²‚ may have carried a copy of the legend thither
with him, or sent it, on his return, to S. Edmund‘s Monastery and that
os Fountains.

Of all the Saints in the Norwegian Calendar there was none so
renowned as King Olal the Martyr, and the Norse ecelesiastics would
be sure, as soon as they could, to make their friends in England ac-
quainted with the merits ol their great national Saint.

III. The contents of the volume relate, as we mentioned before,
to diverse subjects They are enumerated on the first page, in red inlr,
and in a hand probably of the fourteenth century :-

‘In hoc codice continentur Passio domini nostri Jesu Christi³.
Sol[i]loquia Augustini. Item de libero arbitrio ad Valentinum mona-
chum. Et passio sancti Olavi regis et martiris. Et egressio monachorum
cist. de molismo ; et epistola· Turstini episcopi de egressione Fontanensi
de cenobio Sancte Marie de eboracensibus!

The fifth treatise in the volume, ‘Epistola Turstini’-Thurstan
became Archbishop of Yorlr A.D. 1119—was first printed in its entirety
from this volume in Walbran's Memorials of Fourrtaz'ns Abbey, p. 11.
It surpasses all other existing copies in purity and antiquity; andis
