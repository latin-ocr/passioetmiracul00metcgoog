llug0, now dead, had allowed their hnanees to lapse. Anrl yet the
monastery, we sce, managed to keep up its reputation lor hospitality
to strangers without stint. Jocelin hints that the future Abbot
Samson, the sacristan, had seeretly put by some 01 the offerings 01

my lord abbot's chaplain and friend, who gives an inimitable narrative
01 the doings preceding the election‚ and the caballing and murmuring
attendant thereon, makes us aware that matters were in a very delicate
and ticklish position indeed. The king kept the headship vacant sor a
year and three months, and had through his appointed custodians
taken inventories 01 all the monastic property, and set seals on their
muniment boxes. It was'quite within the bounds 01 possibility that
he might iorce upon them as abbot some foreign ecclesiastic, or other
person obnoxlous to the Society. So that Eystein's good offices with
his majesty would be duly appreciated, and are duly recorded, as we
have seen, in this twellth·century note book.

But we ought, besore we leave the monastery, to cast a glimpse
back at its antecedents. The martyr S. Edmund, a prince 01 East
Anglia, who had fallen by Danish arrows just one hundred and sixty
years before king Olal sell at Stikklestad‚ not indeed by Danish arrows
but at all events by Danish intrigue, was at the time the great saint
01 England, competing with S. Cuthbert‚ and perhaps surpassing him
in miraculous power. The cult os S. Thomas 01 Canterbury, who had
been murdered only eleven years previously, was perhaps scarcely so
sully developed. The conventual buildings at S. Edmund's monastery
had been restored by Canute. He had presented the Saint with his ·
own gold erown off ¹his head. And it was at one time fast becoming
one 01 the most splendid establishments in the kingdom, in its magnificent
buildings and rich endowments. S. Edmund's shrine was the constant
resort 01 kings and the great 01 the earth. Here, some hals-dozen years
before, the reigning monarch‚ Henry II, had caused the sacred standard
01 St. Edmund to be borne in front 01 his assembled army (see engraving
01 it, p. 104, Joc. de Brut), and to its influence was ascribed the victory

which he gained over his rebellious sons. The Archbishop would doubtless
compare many notes with the English fraternity, whose doings are told
in so quaint and life-like a manner by Brakelond. As he surveyed the
