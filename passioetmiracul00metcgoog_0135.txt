APPENDIX II. rar

with a large body of artned rnen, whom he had brought with him in contravention
of the stipulations of the niceting. The priest happened to be celebrating the Holy
Communion at the time. F eeling that there was no escape, Magnus partook of the
‘saving sacrifice of the Body 3ηά Blood of Jesus Christ‚' when four ruffian emissaries
of Hacon‚ violating the sanctuary, entered the building and dragged him before their
master. Although he felt certain of his fate, he stood calrn and unmoved in this
terrible moment, and thus addressed his persecutor: ‘You do not well, cousin, in
thus breaking your oath to me; but 1 think that you are not doing this of your own
free will, but at the wicked instigation of others. 1 propose to you three conditionS,
that you may choose one of them rather than break your oath‚ and sufferme,an innocent
man, to be slaughtered.' These conditions throw much light on the notions of that day.
They ran thus-F irstly ¹, that Magnus should be allowed to go as a pilgrim to
Rome, or even to Jerusalem, there to make atonement for the sins of both ; taking an
oath never to return to the Orkneys. This proposal was at once negatived by Earl
Hacon and his men. Secondly, that Magnus should be banished to Scotland 3ηά there
kept in ward for the term of his natural life with a retinue of only two persons, ‘to help
him to pass away the time.' Many objections were raised to this proposition also, and
it was refused. ‘This steadfast knight of Christ now makes his last proposal ; God
knows, not so much for the sake of his own lise! This was either 'mutilation or the
loss of his eyes in either case with perpetual imprisonment. ‘This condition,' said
the cruel Hacon‚ ‘ 1 will accept) But not so his inexorable followers. ‘We will not
consent,’ said they, ‘for Magnus to be tortured and kept alive. One of you we will
slay, and you shall not both of you claim to be masters of the country as heretofore.'
‘Well then,' said Hacon‚ ‘1 had rather be master of the land than die by a sudden
death².’ Magnus on this knelt in prayer, folded his hands before his face, shed
innumerable tears, and commended himself and his cause to God. He then signed
himself with the sign of the cross and bowed to the stroke. The executioner was
Lifolf, Hacon's cook (Steikari)³; his standard-bearer, Ofeig, having indignantly
declined the office. ‘Strike manfully,' said Magnus ; ‘it befits not that princes should
be slain like thieves.' Whereupon Lifolf struck a great stroke at his neck. ‘Strike
again,' cried Hacon‚ although the work was already done; so Lifolfsmote once more.
Thus the Jarl was slain, 3ηά his soul ascended up to heaven. This tragedy was
enacted in the twelfth year of his co·sovereignty of the Orkneys with Count Hacon‚
on Monday 16 Kal. May Aa). 1115, on the second day after the feast of SS. Tiburtius
andValerian.

We now read of certain unmistakeable signs being shown, as in the case of

irland on which it stood might, therefore, very justly be called ‘¹ Charch Isle.'¹ But the ln'sh word
Ecclais (church), derived from the Latin Ecclesia, might easily be mistaken by our forefathers

for Egits, the genitive of the man's name Egit:

³ Literally ‘roasten’ Here we see the etymology of our word ‘steak' Flafeyb. ΙΙ. p. 4343
