Werrneland in Sweden‚ and so on to Russia. ht thc court of Jarisleif,
at Novgorod‚ where his old love Ingigerd was queen, he found a place
of refuge. Here he and his followers stayed some time, enjoying their
friendly hospitality, and here his miraculous powers again came into
play. The son of an honest widow had a grievous boil on his neck, and
as he could swallow no food in consequence, there seemed little chance r
for his lif . The boy's mother went to the queen, whom she knew, and ¹
begged for some remedy. The queen referred her to olas, who laid his
hands on the boy's neck so long a time that he made a wry faces Then
the king took a piece of bread, broke it into the figure of a cross, and put
it in the boy’s mouth, who swallowed it and speedily recovered. Snorri
adds that people at once perceived him to bc one of those men who
have been gifted by nature with the power of healing by the touch, and

this also was numbered among thern ¹. Was our touching for the king's
evil connected with S. Olaf’s handiwork? The author of our legendq
seems to have had some doubt about the authenticity of this miracle, as

miracle‚ stated by Snorri, and in the Louvain Legendary (see p. 46 below), j
to have been performed by the saint in Russia (Storm, ii. 9). Another
miracle is given in Geislr' (xxviii.) and Theod. M onaclzi Hire. c. 24. The
martyr appears to his son Magnus before a battle with the Wends at
Hlyrskogs Heath in Denmark, and bids him take courage3 and he won
the battle. Another account is that the vision bade Magnus select

his soldierS, and he promised that they should be endued with the
power of healing ever after, nay, that the gift should be hereditary in
their family (Biskupq Sirgrcr, i. p. 639). Again King Eric was thrown
frorn his horse ; his foot caught in the stirrup, and he was dragged along, ,
his head bumping against the stones His attendants moumed him as one

dead, buthe was restored by S. Olaf whom they invoked (ibid. i. 743).
