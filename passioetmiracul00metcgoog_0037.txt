had been the custom in Norway before Olal's time lor the sons ol great
men to go rnarauding about, both in the country and out ol the country,
upon their own countrymen and on strangers-in short, to turn Vikings.
'l'his King Olaf resolved to put down, eost what it might. And il any
of the aristocracy were proved to have committed such depredations
they must suffer in lile or lirnb. No offer os money, no entreatieS, could
save them: As Signat sang-

‘He made the bravest lose his head
who robbed at sea and pirates led,
And his just sword gave peace to all,
Sparing no robber, great or small ¹.'

·‘ Hinc illae lacrimae.’ He had made loes ol the aristocracy3 and this
rendered them only too ready to transfer their allegiance to another, to
accept the great sums oi English and Danish money offered by King
Canute, and to jump at the idea of greater dignities which he dangled'
besore their eyes. Such is the key to the whole transaction. He had

caged‚ and clipped the wingsol the great birds of prey, and they turned
and rent him with beak and claw. The masses were not implacable.
It was not with Olal', as with the Roman tyrant—

We may mention parenthetieally that Snorri gives the lie to the
accusation unjustly made against Olaf that he was niggardly with his
money, whereas in fact he was a most genereus man to his sriends².

England to take the rule os his lawless kingdom will retur to the reader: ‘Let God
but grant me life, and there shall not bea spot in my realm where the key shall not
keep the castle, and the bracken-bush the cow, though l should lead the life of a dog
to accomplish it! This noble and uncompromising resolution to hold no terms with
murder and robbery, and to eniorce the laws on high and low alike, was an offence
not to be pardoned by the Scoteh aristocracy, and, like orat, James paid the penalty
with his lise.
