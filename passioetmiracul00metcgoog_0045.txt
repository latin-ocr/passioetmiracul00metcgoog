But Olaf may be regarded in another capacity. With him, Nor-
wegian sovereignty entered on a new phase. It was now looked upon
as thc centre ol order and legality‚ while it had the religious sanction
which it wanted in the days ol heathenism. Sovcreignty had hitherto
been regarded as the result os a compact between the people and the
descendants os Harald llarsagcr. Henceforth the monarch was King
by the grace of God‚ although Magnus Erlingson was first in formal
documents stylcd as such. The great families no longer aimed at
being independent sovereigns under a foreign overlord. Pride os lineage
yielded to the idea of national unity. And so S. Olai is rightly styled
the second founder of the Norwegian realm ².

Adam ol Bremcn‚ a very trustworthy historiari, in his Ecclesiastical
History‚ written 1073-1076, ie. a very few years aster the battle os
Stilrlclestad pays a very high tribute to Olars qualities as a Christian and
a ruler. He states that King Olas was constantly at war with Canute,
but, in the intervals of peace, he governed his kingdom with judgment

name to churches (Antiqm'tates Anzen'canaa p. 310). The same was the case in
Paris, at Rouen, and in Belgium; and his cult extended to the Spanish Peninsula.
christina, daughter of Hacon‚ King os N orway, was married to Alsonso, brother os
the King of Castile‚ and she prevailed on him to erect a church to S. Olaf. At
Constantinople churches were dedicated to him. His worship also extended to
