national saint, S. Olaf, in Trondbjem. All the recorded miracles ol
S. Edmund would doubtless be discussed among them, and many
striking points ol resemblance between the wonder-working os the two
martyrs would be dwelt upon. Very likely the Archbishop leit a copy
oi his own composition, the Passio et miracula Saluti Olaui, at the
monastery where he had been so hospitably entertained3 or sent a
copy ol it on returning to his Northern See. Several churches in
Norway‚ eg. those os Vanelv and L'ur0, which are dedicated to S.
Edmund, are not improbably memorials olbis visit ¹. lt is to be regretted
that we know nothing os this intercourse except srom the short notice
oi Brakelond. Neither do we know at what other English monasteries,
whether at FountainS, or St. Mary's‚ York, or elsewhere, Eystein abode
during the remainder ol his exile. One thing is clear, that the lact of his
excommunicating his own monarch, Swerrir, did not weigh prejudicially
to his interests with the king ol England, as it was by royal mandate
that he was entertained, eost free, by the monks of S. Edmund’s. In
those days there would be no extradition treaty between England and
Norway. Moreover Henry II must have had a keen recollection ol
what came oi his removing srorn his path another equally overweening
and rebellious ecclesiastic, Thomas Becket‚ the degrading prostratio'n
before his shrine at Canterbury‚ and the scourging by the monks to
which he was sain to submit some lew years before, in order to make
his peace with the Church. Becket's name was ringing loudly throughout
England during Eystein’s stay. There were many traits of similarity ·
between the late Archbishop ol Canterbury and his living brother ol
Nidaros, both in their character and career. Both os thern were men ,

y os undaunted mettle, clear mental vision, and high stomach. Both
quarrelled with their sovereign, and both lived in exile. Becket lell

the clutches ol king Swerrir, who, as he knew well, was not a man to be
trilled with. The Norwegian Archbishop would without doubt ponder
