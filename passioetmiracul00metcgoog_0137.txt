Kirkwall‚ which most likely owed its ancient name Kirkiu·Vagr (‘creek of the kirk')
to this church of S. Olaf there¹. ln the words of the Saga (c. 31), from that time
(the date of his canonization) the miracles of the saint became noised about in all the
regions of the West and the North. After the relics were transferred thither the
small town rapidly increased in size. There went up to visit his sacred relics from
the neighbouring countrieS, towns and cities, men strong of beart and with offerings in
their hands. Others sent money to be laid out in ornaments for his shrine, to the
honour of the saint, and for their own cure in this world and souls' help in the next ².
Α notable instance of the belief in the Saint's power is that king Hacon, after the
battle of Largs, when he lay sick at Kirkwall‚ went to the church of S. Magnus and
made a circuit of the shrine.

The author then proceeds to enumerate his miracles, more than twenty in num·
ber. To make sure of deliverance from whatever distress or ailment had befallen them,
people would sometimes make a concurrent appeal to both S. Magnus and S. Olaf,
in order apparently that, failing the help of one, they might be aided by the other.
This was the case with one Elldjam, who was reduced to extremity by famine. S. Mag·
nus came in answer to his prayer, and restored him to health and strength ³. Both S.
Magnus and S. Olaf had heard his prayers‚ but, said the apparition, ‘S. Olaf has been
called away to the West Firths to the relief of a woman who had invoked him,
and has sent me hither in his stead.' Of the marvellous cures effected by this Saint,
e. g. leprosy (llkpra) ⁴, madness, contracted limbs, possession by evil spirits, blindness,
the following seems to outdo all others ⁵. ln the reign of Harald Gille in Norway

two rich men falsely accused two brothers of making improper overtures to their
kinswoman. They then carried them off to the woods, and slew at night the one
whom they most suspected, while they broke both the legs of the other, put out
his eyes, and cut out his tongue, leaving him half dead. Hardly had they gone wh'en a
flock of wolves came, tore in pieces the one who was dead, and then returned to
their haunts. Meantime the miserable survivor makes avow to S. Magnus, whose
miracles were at that time⁶ at the pinnacle of their fame. Immediately the bright

figure of a man stands by him, and gently touches his broken limbs, and the empty¹
sockets of his eyes, then takes the sturnp of his tongue and pulls it. ‘Who art thou ?''
exclaimed the sufferet. ‘1 am Earl Magnus. But remember thy vow.’ ‘Oht good
sir, as you have granted me such a wonderful cure, could you not, by God’s help„
bring my brother to life again?’ The figure gave no response and vanished. But
the convalescent resolved to wait two nights on the spot in prayer to God, and to
watch what would befall. Before long he sees a great flock of wolves come to
