out in England, and much about the same date. The particular work
here selected sor publication is composed in thirty-three solios and a
hals, numbered 57 to 90, all written in the clear broad hand ol one

¹} It is written in single column, and contains twenty-four lines to the
(s page. The initial letters are illuminated in red, green, and blue; while

Ripon by Archbishop Thurstan ol York. The brethren, thirteen in
number, were resugees from the Benedictine Monastery ol S. Mary‚ at
Yorlr, with Richard, the Prior of that foundation, at their head, who was
now nominated first Abbot os Fountains. The iniant establishment
throve apace, and riches soon began to pour in upon it. Within ten
years from its foundation, it supplied members sor several convents.
Pipewell in Northamptonshire, Wobum in Bedsordshire, and Kirkstead
in Lincolnshire, were among the many swarms from the parent hive.
