Olaf, that is from the Chnrclr. That alone perhaps would lead Williarn

of Ncwburgh to style him, as lre doeS, ‘vir magnus) But he here
appears ina new character3 as the literary champion of S. Olaf, the
patron Saint of Norway, and as the author of the only work written iu
Norw'ay rn the middletr ag es which achieved aEuropean reputation‚ and

s was translated into several languag es. The true literary history of the
work would seem to be this. He first wrote down the older traditions
about S Olaf. fHe then, at the risk of seemmg tedrous and prolix, 3ηά

of his unpolished style becoming oppressive to the reader, proceeds to

· relate some further miracles which he knew to have been recently (⁸ nuper’)
performed, 3ηά he does 80, trusting to their religious devotionfp. 97).

’ He next (p. 104), rn a supplementary original tractate, relates further
¹iniraclesf o fS. Olaf‚ to which he could personally bear witness, from which

he himself or others derived benefit, and which redound to the glory

ι’ o fhis Cathedral Church. The work therefore consists of three distinct

parts, and these parts the Archbishop combines and compiles into a
symmetrical whole, and edits for the instruction and edification of all

whom it may concern. The style is the style of his age and of his

vocation, not altogether terse and concise, but, on the contrary, some·
ἱ what prolix and heavy, though in the part referring to his own know·

ledge he exhibits more animation. His speeches recorded in Sverris

Saga, and conveyed in the vernacular, are quite a different affair.

s The miraculous powers of the martyr, as recorded by the Arch-

bishop, the more ancient ones from tradition, the recent ones from
the mouths of credible witnesses, and, lastly, those of which he had
proof positive in his own person or in his own experience, are very
multifarious. There are the usual cases of diseases and ailments mira-
culously cured. Epilepsy, leprosy (even now very prevalent in the
neighbourhood of Bergen), contracted limbs, deafness, blindness, acci-
dental injuries, all these meet with a prompt physician in the Saint.
Undoubtedly, the most interesting miracle, one of which Archbishop
Eystein, the author and editor of this work, was personally cognizant, is
that mentioned at p 105. It carne so thoroughly home to him m hisown ,
proper person and wonderful deliverance, that it is possible we owe toi i
it the realization and completion of the plan over which he had been l

pondering, <sos writing the treatise with a full exposition in order of the j
