consummatus est. Corpus ejus in civitate magna regni sui Thron-
demnis cum decenti est honore tumulatum. Ubi hodieque pluribus
miraculis et sanitatibus quae per eum frunt, Dominus ostendere dig-
natur, quanti meriti sit in celis qui sic glorificatur in terris. Regnavit
autem XII annis. Agitur festivitas ejus tv Kal. Augusti omnibus Sep·
tentrionalis Oceani populis: Nortmannorum, Sueonum, Gothorum, Sem-
bomm (.>), Danorum, atque Sclavorum, eterno cultu memorabilis¹.’ But
Olaf had English Chroniclers too in his favour. F lorence ol Worcester
(1030) writes: ‘S. Olaf, King and lllartyr, whom King Canute had
expelled, returns to Norway, and is unjustly slain by the Norwegians².’
A similar testimony is borne by William of Jumieges (cf. note 4, p. 68
of our legend). He pronounces him ‘a martyr impiously slain by his
own subjects‘ lVilliam of Malmesbury, it is true, does not regard his
memory so tenderly. He recounts an ugly tale of his treatment of
a poor captive, the English lady Elfildis, who became by him mother
of the future King Magnus of Norway. But the historian, while in-
veighing against the unbridled passion of the king, mentions that he
was only acting according to the custom of the country, ‘pro more
gentis suae! lllatters of this sort would perhaps be looked upon with
more lenient eyes by the Icelandic lristorians, according to whom,
'whatever indiscretions Olaf was guilty of in his Viking days, he was
greatly altered for the better afterwards ³.

From what has been said above, it follows as a matter of course
that Olal's name appeared in the Church Services. ln the Breviaries ,
of Nidaros and Sleswig‚ of Skara and of Linkdplng, both in Sweden, and
of Aarhus, in Jutland‚ there are records of his miracles to be read
regularly on the anniversary of his martyrdom. But this rapid ex·
tension of the new worship will seem less surprising when we consider
that in the North Christianity struck root, so to say, in virgin soil,
where the ground was not encumbered by a crowd of saints of all
nations. Olaf, we must remember, was no unknown foreign saint, but
a real native of the country, who had made its name glorious abroad,
