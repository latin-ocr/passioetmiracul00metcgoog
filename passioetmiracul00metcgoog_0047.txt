Hector Boethius, in his Historia Scotorum (Lib. xi, p. 244), pub·
lished in 1526, gives remarkable, il not very trustworthy, testimony to
the early spread ol OlaI-worship. The Danes were beaten with great
slaughter in a battle at Cruden in Buchan ¹, by King hlalcolm, son ol
Kenneth, who died Aa). 1040. After the battle, the king ordered the
corpses os the Danes to be buried, and a church dedicated to S. Olas to
be erected on the spot. The historian's words are, ‘Malcolmus Danos
ac Scotos, qui certamine occiderant, solenni apparatu efferri suls jussit,
ceteros in sancto agro condere. Templum inde ibidem constructum dedi-
catumque, etin eo sacerdotes ad sacra obeunda, salario ex publico ad
inpensas tribut0, instituti. Veteris illius templi Divo olavo, in cujus tutela
Danorum NorwegIcorumque regnum est, aliquot post tempora, ut monu-
mentum esset multam illarum gentium nobilitatem reconditoria illic
habere, tum sacrati vel hoc seculo extant vestigia) We are not therc-

the Aberdeen Breviary (see Appendix Ι), although curiously enough itis
fixed on 111 Kal. April (30 March), with this rubrieal instruction-‘ Si
sesta sanctorum Olavi Martyris et Reguli abbatis lnsra passionem con-
tigerint, seu octavas Paschae, transferri debent, videlicet dies Olavi usque
ad quartas Kalendas Augusti, quo die passio ejusdem celebratur‚’ &c.²

crossed by S. Olal's Bridge. In the reign ol King Henry III there was
a priory built there in honour ol S. Mary and S. Olaf. At Poughill
In Comwall, the church bears his name, and also at Creeting, Suflolk.
In Orkney there was S. Ollow’s parish, now included in that ol
Kirkwall, where also was S. Ollow's bridge. In the neighbouring
Shetland, according to Hibbert³‚ there were churches dedicated to
Our Lady, S. Olla, S. Magnus⁴‚ S. Laurence, S. John, S. Paul, and

¹ S. Olal¹s fair was held there. He Is also found in the lsland ol Lewis (Martin’s
Western lsles‚ p. 27); andan altar was dedicated to him in S. Salvator's College,
S. Andrews. F orbes, K alendars os Scotttslt Sazhts.
