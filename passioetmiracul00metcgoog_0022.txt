8 INTRODUCTION.

throwiug the spcar. lle wasa great swimmer3 he had a skilled eye and
hand in 311 sorts of smith work, whether it was hc or another who was the
artificer. He was called Olaf the Fat ¹. He was bold and ready os
speech. He soon arrived at maturity both of brain and body. He was
beloved by all his friends and acquaintances; eager in his sports and
one who always liked to be first, as it was meet he should be from his
birth and dignity.' With such precocious parts it is not surprising that
he was only twelve years old when he started on his first Viking cruise,
being by constant practice already very strong, and perfect in all
musculas and warlike exercises while his stout short figure doubtless
added to his powers of endurance. Before long he was harrying the
coasts of Denmark, Sweden, and F rauce. Soon after we find him in
England as the active adherent of the unfortunate Ethelred against the
usurping Danes‚ who had also invaded the throne of his father in
Nonvay2. One notable exploit may here be mentioned. The Danes
held the bridge in London, connecting the castle on the North side of the
Thames with the stronghold on the South side, Southwark (Sudrvirki),
where was a considerable place of trade. Here the Danes had raised a great
work, dug large ditches, and within had built a bulwark of stone, timber,
and turf, which was manned by a large force. King Ethelred ordered an
assault, but the Danes defended themselves bravely, and Ethelred could
make nothing of rt Between the castle (on the site perhaps of the present
Tower of London) and South vark there was a bridge so broad that two
waggons could pass each c “Cher upon it Ola and his men having
constructed pent· houses of planks over the decks of his ships, strong
enough to resist the missiles poured from above by the defenders of the
bridge, ‘rowed quite up under the bridge,’ says Snorri, who takes the
account of cont mporary scalds, ‘and fastened his cables round the piles
which supported rt, and his men rowed their hardest down stream? The
result was that the piles were loosened, and gave way; and down fell
the bridge with multitudes of those upon⁵ it, while the rest fled. There-

¹ ‘Olaf digre' (=‘Olaf the Fat’) was the epithet which his namesake the King
of Sweden was fond of contemptuously applying to him. N ay, at one time he would
not suffer him to be mentioned in any other way than as ‘F at' pure aud simple, or by

’ some opprobrious nickname ; Heimskr. c. 66.

exploit.
