Also the following translations ol the legend must be men-
tioned2-

9. Garmnelnorsh Homiliebog (Codex Arn. Magn. 619 Q.V.), ed. C. R. Unger,
Christiania, 1862, 1864, srom a MS. written in Norway, scarcely later than

1200, with the heading: In dre Sancti Olaui regt's er martiris, p. 146-168.

10. Fornsvensk Legendan'um, p. 8 59-871 (Saga om S. Olas Norges K onung) : from
a Swedish MS.‚ Codex BildstenianuS, ol about 1420-50. lt contains the whole
ol the first chapter of our text, together with Chapter Il, Sect. 1-10.

We have now simply to determine the place ol our new text
among these materials lor S. Olat's history.

ln order to restore the legend to its original shapc and sequence, as it
was written in Latin, the work marked 9, the Old-Norse Homily Book, is
our best gnide. For, as would appear lrom the concluding words, it was
appointed to be read entire in the churches on S. Olal's day, andi
exhibits the legend to us as it was, before it became split up and³
arranged for the various Breviaries On a comparison with this Old-
Norse Homily Book, the best Latin text hitherto known was that in the
Codex Bodecensis¹ (printed by the Bollandists, ind), and in the two
West Gotland Breviaries numbered above 3 and 4, which are more
detailed and complete than the other Breviaries. The old Homily ’
Book above mentioned is especially interesting; it must have reached
leeland by 1220, since it was entirely incorporated into Styrmer's S.
Olas's Saga, now lost; and finally it found its way back to Norway‚
with additions by Munk Hall, about 1250, where it was worked into the
legendary S. Olal's Saga ².
