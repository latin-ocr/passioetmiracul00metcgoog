be myself. Iwill be the first to offer money at his shriue: nudas Olaf has
become a saint, I shall not invade Norway) So, the writer in Farn-
manrra Sdgur (v. 207). But, according to llcr'msl‘ringln (ibid. e. 242),
subsequently to the battle, Thorir went to the spot where the dead king
lay, composed his lImbs, and wiped the blood from his cheeks: and
while he was so engaged, the blood touched the wound between his finger
and thumb‚ and healed it at once. The conscience-stricken murderer
was greatly struck by the beauty 01 the king’s face. Not as yet-

‘Decny’s effaeing fingers
Had swept the lines where beauty lingers.²

Sootlr to say, the king was in the very prIme 01 manhood. He was only
thirty-four. His noble countenance had been drawn by a careful observer3
and the portrait, as the reader will remember, was exhibited by us on a
previous page. Thus died Olaf, cordially hated by the majority 01 his
subjeets, yet greatly beloved by his nearest retaIners. Os these was
Thormod the scald, who, when the spear-head, at his own request, was
being torn out 01 his own vitals‚ after the battle, died singing of the
heroism of his master. Of these, too, was his other scald, Sigvat.

VIII. The beginning of their affectionate intimacy was on this wise.
Sigvat, on his arrival at the Norwegian court of Nidaros from Iceland,
made a lay in honour of the king, olaf, and asked him to listen to it.
Unlike his half-brother, Harold Hardrada, who was not only a skilful
scald but the idol of the sealds, the king, in the early days 01 his eon·
version to Christianity, seems to have had a general prejudice against
sealds and all their works‚ as savouring of heathenism. So he replied
to Sigvat's invitation that he did not want poems composed about him,
and that he did not understand the scald’s craft. Then Sigvat sang-

‘Spoiler of dark blue ocean’s steeds!
Allow one scald to sing thy deeds;

And listen to the song 01 one

Who can sing well if any can.

For should the king despise all others,
And show no favour to my brothers,
Yet, I may all men’s favour claim,

Who sing still 010222 great king's fame¹.'

literal for our purpose.
