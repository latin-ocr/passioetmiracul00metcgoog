when they are about to issue lrom the hoie, the opening sinks in, and is
stopped up at the prayer os Olal. Then cried a strong old giant, ‘Lead
me to the place where the opening was, and let me have a try. 1 have
broken bigger crags than this with my head!' So twelve shoved him
on one side, and twelve on the other, and hurled him so hard against the
rock that his neck broke, but the cave’s mouth remained shut, so that not·
one escaped. They ate each other up, and the strongest lasted longest.

By an easy transition the name ol the Saint would pass srom the
ballad to the proverb in the mouth of the vulgar. To quote one or
two instances. ‘Many tell ol S. Olal who never saw him;’ a piece ol‘
homely wisdom, which in our own tongue has been connected with
another personage3 ‘Many speake of Robin Hood that never shot in his
bowe.’ Again, ‘That will be, when S. Olal comes back to the North'
=‘at the Greek Kalends 3’ and ‘From the days when S. Olat was little’
=‘ lrom the days ol eld.'

painting and sculpture. Most ol these works ol art no longer exist. But
to judge stom the descriptions given of them, Olas generally appeared
crowned‚ battle-axe in hand, and treading undersoot a Troll or Dragon.
So in the Museum os Northern Antiquities at Copenhagen1, there is
the antependium ol an altar, from Trondhjem, picturing Olal's exploits‚
and also a silver spoon, with Olas sitting, with both leet on the crowned
and tailed Prince os Darkness2. Among the articles enumerated in an
inventory ol the treasury ol the Cathedral os Aberdeen in 1518 there is
a similar image ol S. Olal os silver decorated with precious stones ³. ln
Norway there are several altar-pieces in carved wood, most os which
were executed abroad on order srom home. S. Olas and S. Sunniva
are the Saints who occur most commonly in these works oi art ⁴· Thus

rfthe altar-piece at Ringsaker Church⁶ was ordered from Antwerp by the
vicar, Arnstein Johnsson Skanke (1502-1544). Or course this would
indirectly contribute to the cult oi the Saint in foreign parts. And so
