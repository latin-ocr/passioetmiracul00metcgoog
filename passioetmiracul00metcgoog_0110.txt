⁴ ln Appendix to Ketell’s Miracles (ff S. John os Bewerlw, which Appendix‚ ac·
cording to Canon Raine, must have been written between aa). 1170-1180-at like
miracle was wrought in the church of Beverley. There it is a Frenchman and a lra-
tricide, who, alteruisiting S.Andrews in Scotland as a penitent, has arrived at Beverley.
He hasbeen wandering about sor a whole year. Whilst in the church‚ an iron girdle‚
which he wore round his middle as a penance, burst asunder. The writer heard the
erack. The penitent says he was ordered to wear it sor slaying his brother. ln our
legend, we observe, there are two French fratricideS, one a clerk, the other a layman.
They were matricides as well. Their journey of penance, moreover, had extended to
Jerusalem, and alter that up rothe chureh ol S. Olaf at Nidaros. The Archbishop,
however, does not include this miracle in the number of those which had occurred
during recent times. These begin in the next section. Had this traditional miracle,
thus recorded in the Archbishop’s compilations, been transferred from John of Beverley
to S. Olaf? Cf. Hr'slon'ans oslke caurcle os l'ork and its Archbislrops, vol. i. p. 308
