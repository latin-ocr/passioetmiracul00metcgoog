126 APPEn'Dm' IV.

seems to have been the ordinary method ol representing him in the oldest period:

while in the late pictures ol the lourteenth and lilteenth century he always appears
with the axe in the right hand, and a chalice in his lest, treading on a dragon with
acrowned human head (the symbol os the overthrow ol heathenism)‚ and clad in
armour. Around this figure are lour compartmentS, giving scenes of his life and
death ln the lowest to the right is ¹represented the death of S. Olal at Stikklestad,
July 29, 1030, pretty nearly as recorded in the Sagas. The King has thrown away his
sword and shield and is fallen to the earth. Kalf Amesen plunges his sword into his
neck, Thon‘r Hund pierces him with a lance, and Thorstein Knarrarsmed strikes him
on the lmee with an axe. At the same time a soldier of Olal’s wounds Kalf in the
ebech, and Thorir Hund bleeds in his left hand. ln the lower compartment to the
left the King on horseback gives a lull purse toa monk. Above on the right the
Kings body is exhumed (Aug. 3, 1031). An elderly Bishop (? Grimlrel) anoints the
corpse, and a younger Bishop sprinkles holy water. Clergy are chaunting. In the
higher compartment to the left we have the King’s dream before Stikklestad
(Snorri, Olus den Hell. Saga, cap. 226). lle sees heaven opened and a ladder up to
it. Above is Christ, stretching out his hand and blessing the sleeping King. One ol
the King’s men blows ahorn to wake the army to the battle. . . . This picture may,
to judge from the custumes and ornaments, be pretty sasely assigned to about the
year 13oo ln the catalogue of 1737 it is described as ‘a very ancient picture which
was brought from Trondhjem in the year 1691.”'
