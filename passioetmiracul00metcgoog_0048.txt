S. Sineva¹‚ some of which, however, were ercetetl by foreign seanren in
fulfilment of a vow to some tutelar saint. The Shetlanders boasted that
they had received their laws from the Saint3 and in their ancient songs,
‘vissaeks’ or ‘ visecks’ (=1s. ‘visar'), which formed an accompaniment to
their daneeS, and which were still in vogue not long before Lowe's visit
'to Shetland in 1774, he occupied a prominent place. The writer in the
Bpllandists (July 29, vii. 88) argues from the number of parish churches
dedicated to the Saint in London that he must have been extensively
worshipped in England.and received into the English Calendar². These
were as follows: S. Olave'S‚ on the west side of Bread Street Hill‚
in Queenhithe, burnt down at the Great Fire, when the parish was
annexed to S. Nicholas, Cole Abbey3 S. Olave’s, Hart Street; S.
Olave'S‚ Old Jewry‚ rebuilt after the fire3 S. Olave'5‚ Silver Street³, in
the ward of Aldersgate, burnt down at the Great Fire, and annexed
to S. Alban's‚ Wood Street ⁴. In Southwark also is a church with his
name, just below London Bridge. Exete‘n Chichester‚ Chester⁵‚ and
York still have churches dedicated to him. Dugdale⁶ states that in
the reign of William the Conqueror‚ Alan, Earl of Bretagne, gave
S. Olafs Church at Yorkl, with four acres of land to build offices upon

(the ‘caput abbatiae’ of S. Mary's), to certain monks from Whitby;

³ ‘lhe cult of the Saint may be traeed very late. ‘On the 29th. of July‚ being S.
Olave¹s day, was the church holiday in Silver Street, the parish church whereof was
dedicated to that Saint And at eight of the eloek at night began a stage-play, of a
goodly rnatter [relating‚ it is like, to that Saint]‚ that continued unto twelve at mid-
night ; and then they made an end with a good song.¹ Strype’s Memor. Ecclesiastical,
