‘ his work, wonderfully well conversant with mediaeval and classic Latin
literature—was dedicated by the author to Eystein ¹. This would seem
of itself to indicate that the Archbishop was a man of culture and in·
tereste'd in the history os his country. On his return from exile, from
dictates doubtless os worldly wisdom‚ he made his peace with King
Swerrir, and resumed his see. As sar as outward appearances went,
he continued to maintain this attitude‚ resolving to wait and watch the
course os events, while the king, ior his part, judged it the best policy not
to drive the sufficiently humbled churchman to desperation. At length,
on the sall oi Magnus in 1184, the Archbishop selt that his connexion
with politics was at an end. He had played his game out, and in
Swerrir he had found more than his match. Swerrir was himself
brought up as a cleric, and had known how to estimate at their true
value the resources oi the spiritual power. Towards the close os his
liie prudente, not passion, regulated the action os the Archbishop;
and it was from considerations ol that kind, and not from any weak-
ness or vacillation oi character, that he allowed his animosity against the
king to entirely subside.

In 1185 we find him giving the consent os the Church to the mar-
riage oi Swerrir's sister, Ceciha, with the powersul Northern noble,
Baard Guttormson of Rein, although her first husband was still alive;
she having previously proved to the satisfaction of the Archbishop that
she had been forced into her previous marriage by Jarl Erling Skakke
(Sverris S. 9²· [100]). In the autumn oi 1187 the Archbishop fell sick
at Nidaros, and kept his bed till alter Christmas. Being sensible that
his end was approaching, he sent word to King Swerrir to come and
visit him, which he did. They had a long conversation touching many
transactions in which they had been engaged together. When they
parted‚ the Archbishop begged the king's pardon for any trespasses he Ι
might have committed against him, and said that he had been guilty
oi things which he selt were not according to God's law. The two
thereupon became entirely reconciled, and lorgave each other everything
they had done amiss (Sverris S. 98 [107]).

Such at all events was the account given by the king os this last
