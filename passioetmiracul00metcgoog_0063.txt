century, and one which, up to the present time, was scarcely known
to exist, or, which amounts to the same thing, had never been
carelully examined. The Old-Nosse Homily Book, which is very in·
teresting as being probably the oldest extant book written in Norway,
contains five more chapters ol the Olas legend than the best previously
known Latin one, and was, until now, supposed to be a complete work. Ι
But we now lind that the Corpus Christi manuscript is fuller still. It i
contains not only the Latin ol those extra five chapters, but also others. l
Besides, in this manuscript is a continuation-due, not to tradition, ³
but to the recent accounts ol eyewitnesses‚ and also to the author's
own personal experiences, containing moreover details which throw
an interesting light on contemporary manners and customs Add to
which, the name os the author is here first revealed. It was Eystein,
or Augustinus, second archbishop os Trondhjem ¹, consecrated 1161 ,ἐ

² So Snorri, Olafden Helliges Saga, c 245. His words are: ‘A chapel was erected
and the altar set up first on the same spot where King Olaf had been buried, and upon
this site now stands Christ Church. Archbishop Eystein placed the high-altar on the
same spot where the corpse had lain, when he raised the great Minster, which is
now standing. The high-altarol the old Christ Church had also stood there) But
ib. c. 271, Snorri says, ‘Olas (Kyne) caused to be erected the stone church in the
city, in that spot where the remains os King Olas were first interred, and he com-
pleted the Minster, and it was dedicated under the name of Christ Church (ab. 1077).
Here was the Bishop’s throne and Olal’s shrine? Snorri here alludes to the older
church os the eleventh century, in the place os which Eystein built the modern Christ

Church.
