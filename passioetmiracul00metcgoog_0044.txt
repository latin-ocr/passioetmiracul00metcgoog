eve ol sailing sor England, in 1066, had the shrine os S. Olas opened,
cut the nails and the hair of the Saint, and having reclosed and locked
the shrine, threw the key into the Nid (c. 83), and it is expressly added
that the shrine was not opened lor the next 180 years, so that it is
impossible King Magnus could have done it.' The real object ol
Magnus in this expedition was, that he might secure his power in
