church at Nidar05, occurs in the work of Thjodrik the monk ¹. But
there is infernal evidence in Thjodrik to prove that he was also acquainted
with, and made use of, the original Latin legend, and that therefore
this existed either in a briefer form or in the enlarged shape which it
subsequently assumed before he wrote his history (ml). 1177-80). Now
who was the author of that original Latin legend? It has been assumed
by Maurer that the author was a foreigner, on account of the way in which
he speaks of Norway and Norwegians, e. g. in the preamble. But the
reason for this seems to be that the legend was intended not merely for
Norway‚ but l⁰ be read also abroad; and it did in fact obtain a wide
circulation in foreign countries. Professor Storm, who, in the work
mentioned above (p. 46), has recently re-edited the whole of the Latin
1· legend, taking as his text the Acta Brevia of the Codex Bodecensis, and
piecing it together, and arranging it from thevarious authorities ², and to
whom the present writer is indebted for much of the information con-
veyed to the reader in the last page or tw0, and generally throughout the
work, carne to an opposite conclusion. He has stated his conviction from
intemal evidence that the original legend was composed in Nidaros³
(Trondhjem) by some cleric connected with the cathedral (p. xxxv). ,
f He was led to this conviction by the fact that, of nineteen miracles
{r recorded as having occurred after the Saint's death, four take place in the
’ cathedral; two happen to persons who in gratitude for their deliverance
’ tum priests and minister there; one close by Trondhjem3 while two
others occur at Stikklestad.

In this posture of affairs, the present editor was led to examine
the Corpus Christi manuscript. On comparing it with the fullest ex-
tant account of the miracles, viz. the Old-Norse Homily Book men-

ἱ tioned above, he made some interesting discoveries. In the first place,
ἵ Professor Storm’s conjecture that the author was an official of the
cathedral of Nidaros has been triumphantly realized, and that in
an unexpected manner. Here we have a complete history of the Ι
, ’ miracles of the Saint, in handwriting of the close of the twelfth
