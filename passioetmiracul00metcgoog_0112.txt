¹The writer is engaged in building Trondhjem Cathedral: see Introduction. How f
much of it was actually built by him seems doubtful. According to Nicolaysen (Norske ξ
Fornlerwinger, p. 579), he commenced the Cathedral 1161, and built the transept ⁸
and also the Chapter House (Sacristy), where he was buried, 1188. The Cathedral was
323 feet long, and the west front was 124 feet wide. There were fires in 1328,
1432,1557; after which last the west end was abandoned and fell into min, in
which state it now appears. The best authority is Professor Munch's T rondhjems
Domkirke. See above, p. 61.

² ‘Angar’ is plainly written in MS. without contraction. ln the county (fyller‘) of
Orkedal, a little south of Trondhjem, was a place called Hangrar or Angrar, with a
church, mentioned in Snorri’s Olass Saga 3 cf. Munch, Hr'st.·geogr. Beskr. p. 82.

³ Sic in CCC.

⁴ Ao error of the scribe for cognoscerent.

⁵ Sic in C. C. C. without any contractiori. In the MS. before the copyist, orat all
events in the Archbishop’s original, it was probably XL (·forty), which the writer
mistoolr for the contracted form of ‘essent’ or ‘esset,’ ef. p. 112, l.8 below. Forty
marks was the price ofa man in Norway in the twelfth century.
