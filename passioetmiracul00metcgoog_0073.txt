but for this miracle, the author's lile would have been cut short, and his ,Ι
book with it. Here we actually see that glorious labric, the Cathedral ,
os Trondhjem, rising alost in unique beauty, seven hundred and more
years ag03 about the architecture os which and its several parts so many
conflicting hypotheses have been broached. The Archbishop, we shall
see, was one of those great ecclesiastical architects ol the middle ages to
whom posterity is so greatly indebted, and whom it has in vain attempted

to rival. &He is summoned by the master of the works (magister qui
§operariis ecclesie preest') to give instructions as to some architectural
difficulty which has arisen. With a light heart he mounts the scas-
-solding, along which stones sor the building were being drawn, ac·
companied by a mixed crowd os workmen and monkS, the latter, whose
duty it was to be in attendance on the Primate, doubtless anxious

to view the progress of the great work. The scaffolding is not strong s.
enough to bear the weight, and breaks down. The rest of the people ’
succeed in clinging to the scafsolding3 the Archbishop alone falls into
the ahyss below as a punishment, perhaps, lor his sins, notably his
want ol caution in riskinga life on which so much depended. He is
providentially saved from destruction, though he leil on the thin edge os ξ’
a mortar pail. He is carried insensible in the arms of the monks to his ⁴
cubiele. With returning consciousness a twoiold pain distresses him-his
broken ribs, and the thought that on the third day was the ‘birthday’

ol the martyr, when a concourse oi people came from far and near, and a l
grand procession would take place in which it was his duty to bear a ’
principal part. In this strait the Archbishop prays to his patron S. Olaf, ἶ
not trusting to his own merits, but lull oi saith in the efficacy os prayer

to the saint. His prayer is heard. At dawn on the day ol the festival,
when the bells toll to summon the people, the Archbishop is supported

by the monks into the church, although so weak was he that he never
could have supposed he would be able to attend the service at all. The
bodily pain abates, and with it his confidence increases3 iorthwith he calls ³
ior his robes that he may take his place in the procession with the
monks. When the corta-‘ge arrived at the place where it was usual to
call a halt and preach a sermon (doubtlessa homily on S. Olas¹s miracles),

he proceeded briefly to insorm the crowd ol the Pope's indulgence sor s
