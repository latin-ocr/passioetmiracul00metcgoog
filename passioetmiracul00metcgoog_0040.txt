rlhiia replicd‚ ‘ Ι will believe iu the sanctity os his hair is it will not burn

much longer than this man's’ The bishop then put live coals in a pan,
blessed them, cast incense upon them, and laid King Olai’ s hair on the
fire. When all the incense was consumed‚ the hair still remained intact.
Alfiia asked that the hair might be placed on mrconsccrated fire. But

· that great man, Einar Tambarskelver, whom the royal party could not

venture to offend, hushed her down, and a Thing being summoned by
permission of the king, who made avirtue oi necessity, it was determined
that Oiai should be considered truly holy. The royal party-or rather
Alfifa, who was the real ruler, Swend being a puppet in her hands-had
resisted as long as they decently could. They now gaveway. The body
was removed to S. Clernent’s Church‚ which was a considerable distance off
in the city, and was placed in a coffin near the high altar under a gold·
embroidered canopy, and exposed to popular veneration. Subsequently
it was removed to Christ Church‚ the present cathedral ¹. Sigvat, his
friend, was of course not silent.

‘1 lie not when l say the king

Seemed as alive in everything‚

His nails, his yellow hair all growing,
And round his ruddy cheek still flowing!

But even the lcelandic poet Thorarin Lostunge, a scald who had won
great distinction at the English court, and was now poet laureate to
Swend, ventured in an ode, called Glelogn, upon his patron the new king,
to express the all-potent feeling of the day, that the martyr had become
a saint. The king and queen must have felt ill at ease as they heard
stanzas like these sall irom his lips :-

‘Swend king oi all From heaven looks down,
ln Olai’s hall- Where saintly crown,
May our gold-givet Of life-long deed,

Live here sor ever- The glorious meed,
Now sits on high, At length he has won

And Olai's eye Next God's own Son.
