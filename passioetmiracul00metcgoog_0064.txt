without consulting the Chaptcr3 and, although thus arbitrarlly chosen‚

maintain its rights, Hc was descended on the lather's side lrom one os
the leading lamilics in the kingdom, being grandson to Harald Hardrada’s
marshal, Ull, a lineage which doubtless lent additional weight toliis
authority. No sooner was he installed in his office, than he began
to impressori the bonders how important it was to increase the income,
and so uphold the worldly dignity, os the See. The same lesson he took
care to instil into Earl Erling, belore crowning his boy son Magnus at
Bergen,]though he formulated it in a somewlrat different shape, viz. that
‘God’s rights must be iu every way upheld.' And, indeed, father and
son could not resist this able and eloquent ecclesiastic, for they were well
arrare that the main saleguard lor Magnus' sovereignty would be his
elevation to the throne with the sanctions of religion. An animated
conversation is recorded by Snorri as having taken place between Erling
aud the archbisliop before the coronation, 1164, wherein each roundly

document entitled ‘Privilegium et iuramentum Regis Magni qui primus
coronatus Nidrosiae,’ dated ix. Kal. April 1176, srom the vestry of the
church of Nidar0s; which, therefore, il genuine, would possess ad-

In this paper the king solemnly places himself and his kingdom henceforth
aud lor ever under the power and protectionol God and S. Olas 3 while to -
Eystein and the church ol Trondhjem he promises great rights and
privileges. But unfortunately lor the dramatic interest os the proceeding,
the above document has been clearly shown by Maurer and Storm to
be not genuine.

Throughout the succeeding civil war we find our Archbishop
staunchly supporting king Magnus against the pretender Swerrir. He
encouraged the former and his adherents by every means in his power.
Thus he promised them, il they lell on the field of battle, instant
