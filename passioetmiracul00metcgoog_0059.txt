in the church of Our Lady at L'ubeclr is a pointing, the chief figure in
which is the Saint, in full armour, battle-axe in hand, and a royal mantle
flung over his shoulders; with one foot he treads on a dragon, which has
the head of a man ¹. At S. Olaf's Church‚ Reval, he holds a dagger².
In Icelandic MSS. the Saint appears as a frontispiece, sitting in his
high seat, an axe in the right hand and a ball in the left, and a dragon

under his feet ³. ’

Sometimes the axe is in the left, while in his right are three round
‘Olafstones’ one upon another, in memory of the loaves turned into
stones (see miracle p. 78 below). In Iceland these stones were generally
to be found in every church dedicated to S. Olaf. They were hammered
out of lava, and were originally three in number ⁴. The memory of S.
olaf, in fact, was constantly appearing in the life of the Northmen.
Olafsen and Povelsen, who wrote an account in Danish of their travels
in Iceland (1752-1757), in reference to the district of Borgar-ljord, say,
‘they have a particular game at draughts called “ S. Olaf’s tavl,'‘ which
is played blindfolded, while they recite an old ballad, which must be
learned by heart. The spectatore during the game maintain perfect
silence’ (Vol. I, p. 100, b 291, German translation).

An amusing illustration of the universal power of the Saint, and proof
of his hold on the popular imagination, is afforded in the correspondence
of Olaus Wormius ⁵, p. 257. Stephanus Stephanius sends to Ole Worm‚ in
September 1644, a box of curiosities frorn Norway, including the Arcus
lapideus Divi olavi. Worm, within the week, aclrnowledges the safe
arrival of the objects, destined for his museum. Ardent must have been
the expectations of the Danish antiquary, as he opened the box wherein
was stowed ‘the stone bow of S. Olaf;' great, or perhaps small, must
have been his disappointment. He gives vent to it as follows: ‘Arcus

royal robes, crowned, with the legend ‘S. Holofius.' ln his left hand is his axe, in his
right, what is popularly supposed to be two plum cakes. These are the loaves of the
miracle. But see p. 79, note 3. On the seal of S. Olaf's Priory, Herringfleet, the king
