2. Saint Olas down on the ocean strand
Had built him a gallant Snnke¹‚
And now on the Trolls at Homolen,
His vengeance resolved to take.

. Answered the steersman as on the broad deck
With tiller in hand he stood;
“So loathly the Trolls at Hornelen,
That harhour was never good?

. Up spake King Olaf so free and bold,
And sprang on his Ox’s² prow;
“Take tackle on board, and now cast oli,
ln Jesus' name let g0.''

. The Ox he pnff'd‚ and loud he blew,
And over the billows strode;
So sail'd Saint olaf to Homolen,
With woe to the Trolls' abode.

. The giant he stalk'd honi out the hill,
Along the hoary rock5‚
And saw there olas the sainted king,
And breasting the wave his Ox.

. His eyes were like two burning pyren
And yawning his mouth to shout;
Beyond his fingers his finger-nails,
Like the horns of a goat, stuck out.

. A beard he had like a horse's mane,
That hung to touch his knee;
His tail was long, and shagg’d with hair,
And searsul his claws to see.

. “There never in older times or since
A Snake-ship has come to land,
That off to my cavern I could not drag,
With only a single hand.”

. “Then‚'’ answer’d him Olas, the sainted king-
He sear’d not a Trollish soe-
“Throw over the Ox thy cords and chains,
And see how that will g0.’³
