East, and his old friends and supportem, the upland kings lound out
what a capital blunder they were guilty ο1 when they lilted him over
their heads ¹. Like others before him and since, he read the lesson
ο1 Christianity the wrong way. ,In him fanaticism is exemplified in its
most cruel phase. But he acted according to his lights. It must be
remembered that from his boyhood upwards he pursued the Viking
trade, which thought nothing ο1 shedding human blood. Not but
what, as years went on, he greatly improved on Olaf Tryggvason, who
was a Viking to the core, even in his onslaughts on the idol temples.
