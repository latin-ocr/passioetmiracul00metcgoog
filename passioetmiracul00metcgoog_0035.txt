tianity upon them. Yet his predecessor on the throne, Olaf Trygg-
vason, was, as we have seen, not a whit less cruel. Then why was
he the idol of his countrymen while his namesake was thoroughly
detested? The answer to this question lies in the common saying,
‘One man may steal a horse, while another may not look over the
hedge.‘ There was a something in the elder Olaf' s character which
the younger wanted. With all his great capacity, S. Olaf was not¹
nearly so brilliant a personage, so irresistibly winning, as Tryggvason,
whose enthusiastic nature shed a sort of halo about the man and ·
made people lose sight of the damning fact that, if his namesake was
hard and crucl, Tryggvason ‘was ol all men most cruel.’ (Saga
Olass Τ ryggvas. c. 92.) There was a sort of knightly grandeur about
his violence, which soltened the bitterness of his defeated foes, There
was, so to say, in S. Olafs zeal for Christianity an element of world-
liness and calculation. He had more of Jacob than of Esau in his
composition. His nature may have been deeper than Tryggvasou's, ἶ
but it was narrower. And his reforms are not free from personal
vengefulness and hatred. Instances of small-minded persecution are
told of him, which were rather calculated to stir up than to quell
opposition. He cared not, like Tryggvason, to show placability at
the right moment. But, above all, he had not the luck of his pre-
decessor. The task before him was quite as momentouS, but not so
thankworthy.

IX. The elder Olaf was the leader in that great break between the
old and the new, where the God of the Christians and the God of
, the heathens, with their respective adherents, met in a pitched battle3
, where, in the hot tumult of the stay, the individual combatants forgot
ζ their wounds-forgot that the victory was achieved at their own cost—
ι in their admiration of the dash and power of the victor. Careful note
ss must be taken of the spirit of the age, and of the people concerned.

3 The Norwegians were a race whose tastes were warlike in the extreme, ἲ

and who could appreciate warlike qualities.
‘ Olaf Haraldson's task, on the other hand, was to follow up the

victory in detail, to consolidate and arrange, to draw out the great
consequences of the change in regard to the Laws and the constitution.

As Odd Munk said (Saga Olafs T ryggvasonar, Manch’s ed. c. 39), ‘Olaf
