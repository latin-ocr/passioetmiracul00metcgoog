S. Olal, that the victim had become a saint. As, on the field os Stikklestad,a
fountain rose where S. Olaf fell, so here the place of execution, which was before

swampy and stony, now assumed the greenness and beauty of Paradise¹. At first
the rancorous Hacon forbade Magnus’ burial in a church, so he was laid in the spot
where he had suffered. subsequently Hacon relented,and the remains were transported
for burial to Christ Church in Birgisherad (Birsay)‚ Hrossey. As in the case of
S. Olaf,a celestial light was often seen to play over the tomb, and people in
peril began to make vows to S. Magnus, and to ask his help. Moreover‚ a heavenly
fragrance was perceived round about his testing place, to inhale which was a specific
against sickness. The news of this spread, and sick people from the Orkneys and
Shetlands kept vigils at his tomb, and were made whole. lt was now quite plain
that he was a saint, but men spoke of it in whispers so long as Count Hacon lived.
ln further proof of the favour of heaven, it was said that all the persons who, by
their wicked machinationS, made bad blood between the two cousins, and had laid
snares for Magnus Jarl, came to a violent end. Count Hacon, for his part, after
making himself master of the whole Orkneys, made a pilgrimage to Rome, 3ηά
from thence to Jerusalem, ‘as was the custom of the Palmers in those days².’ Having
washed in Jordan he returned to his dominions, which he govemed with prudence
and moderatiori, and became popular with his subjects.

But we must now return to' S. Magnus. His remains, as we have seen, had
been buried at Christ Church⁸, in Hrossey, then the seat of the Bishop. Here
they reposed for twenty years. Some years later, when the new Cathedral of S.
hlagnus, Kirkwall (commenced under the superintendence of Kol, father of Earl
Rognvald ll, in 1137) ⁴, was ready to receive the relies, they must have been trans-
ferred thither.

Bishop William, the first Bishop of the Orkneys, long doubted the sanctity of
Magnus (Flateybok, ll. p. 436), but a miracle, worked by the Saint in his favour at
sea, removed his scruples, and on the festival of St. Lucia at Yule, the anniversary of
his burial (p. 534, Magnus Saga), the body of the saint was by his orders dug up,

’ rising almost to the surface of the ground of its own accord (as in the case of S.

Olaf). lt was then washed, and subjected to tire, but remained unconsumed; on the
contrary it‘looked like pure silver and changed into the shape of across. It was
then placed in a shrine. His festival, both that of his burial in winter and that of his
death in April, 'was established by law, and he was proelaimed a saint and canonized
by the Pope (ib. c. 30). Shortly after, at the request of the saint, who appeared
‘to one Gunni· of Westrey, the relies were deposited in the Church of S. Olal at

⁸ lt was built by Earl Thorfinn some time about the middle of the eleventh century: most
likely about the year 1150, after his retum from a pilgrimage to Jerusalem. It was the seat of
tlte bishopric before the erectiori of S. Magnus’; and william the Red, who was the first actual

bishop, lived to see the bishopric transferred to Kirkwall some time after 1137.
