On these occasions the shrine of S. Olaf was opened‚ and sor some

years the Saint's uails and hair were solemnlycut and clipt. A procession
was then formed, which was headed by the Archbishop, wearing a mantle
ol gold, and bearing on his shoulders an image os the Holy Trinity of
pure gold. After him marched three monks with the silver cross of
S. Olaf. The shrine (‘ loculus ’) of S. Olaf, which was of wood, and
double, having an inner case, came next, borne along by sixty men.
From the end of the coffer, which was covered with gold and silver, hung
an infinite number of little bagS, to receive the offerings of the faithful.
On the shrine stood the so-called ‘Penitentiarius’ with Papal indulgences
for sale—a most lucrative affair, lor it sometimes yielded in one day as
much as four or five thousand pounds of silver. We must not omit to
mention that, as the Cathedral had great revenues, the ecclesiastical
buildings and their appliances were magnificent in proportion3 and silver
plate, such as tankards and goblets and dishes, was in abundance.
But all this grandeur was destined to be of short duration. Thrice the
Cathedral was struck by lightning3 and at the Resormation‚ not content
with stealing all the valuables and works of art, the fanatica] mob set fire
to the building.
' Peder FriiS, who was Torlaeus' informant, attributes the whole
building to Archbishop Eystein ¹. But so gigantic a work was scarcely
due to one man, or one age. An account of the Cathedral, by the
celebrated antiquary, Gerard Schdning Rector of the High School,
Trondhjem, appeared in the Proceedings of theLiterary Society of
that city, 1762. But this is superseded by the description of the
Cathedral by Professor Munch2.

Siuee writing the above, 'we have lighted on the following account
in another work by Professor Munch. ‘Olaf Tryggvason built the first
church in Nidaros, S. Clement'S, but only ol wood. It was rebuilt of
stone by S. Olaf. His church of S. Clement was hitherto wrongly sup-

a person of great intelligence. According to tradition this represents Eysteinhimself.

the whole work and finished the transepts, was continued under Sigurd, who founded
the nave, and completed under Archbishop Jdn, ab. 1280.
