was being carried in procession‚ it became too heavy to move. The source
ol this legend is not known¹. To Magnus Bareloot he assigns N os. xi 3ηά
vii, to his sons Nos. xii and v, and to Harald Gille's sons, vi and viii.
Although the shrine os the Saint was removed srom his country,
and the very place where his bones rest is not known, yet his name
lives on in popular superstition. Fountains os water, which issued forth
to give him drink when he thirsted, and which are possessed of miracu·
lous powers, are still pointed out ². The name os the Saint, who, by
introducing Christianity, had rescued the poor ignorant natives from
the power ol Satan and his myrmidons, became associated, as we have
seen above, in the national solk-lore with the heroes os the old my-
thology, with the god Thor, and the wars which he waged with the
Trolls and giants. The Saint’s axe would do duty sor the god’s hammer;
Mjolnir and his charger would take the place ol the goats which draw
the Thunderer's chariot. His church-building introduced the sound of
bells into their retreats, which these beings could not endure; while his
constant weapon ol offence and deleme, the Holy Rood, was equally
distastelul and calamitous to them. All over the North the traveller

meets with confirmation strong ol the power he exercised over them.
The rock of Hornelen or Bremanger in Norway, which is some 2500 seet
high, was formerly partos the isle called Maro, but now there is a sound

between them. This was the work of the Saint. So says the Danish
ballad³.

S. OLAF AT HORNELEN.

1. ‘Saint Olal¹ good king, o'er Norway¹s land
So well and so wisely reign'd,
God’s word he made wile and man obey,
And justice and law maintain’d.

Red as gold gleams tlte sun o'er Trondhjem.

Prim's Danau Ballads. The old editor, Vedel, explains these reminiscences in the
popular ballads os S. olar’s power over the Trolls to mean, that by spreading the
knowledge os God's word, he rescued the simple natives from the power of Satan and
bis evil spirits, which oppressed them in the d'ays os error and ignorance. Grundtvig
suggests that the MS. before Vedel must have been a Norwegian and not a Danish
one The subject did not escape Oblenschlager, Folkevr'ser, 144
