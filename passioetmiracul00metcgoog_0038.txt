He would not let the Norse aristocracy maintain that independence
for which they had rebelled; nor could they in turn brook the Danish
laws imported with Swend. These were oppressive‚ not to say ex·
tortionate‚ in the extreme. But what gave most offence was the
enactment that in courts of law ‘one Danish witness should invali-

Stikklestad it was not without difficulty that their leaders had got

up in a very short space ol time, and its leaders dispersed as soon as they
heard that 01an retreating army had repassed the Keel Mountains.
