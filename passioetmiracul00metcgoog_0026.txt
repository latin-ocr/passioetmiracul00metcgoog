places before us a little sketch of him as he sat in Hali in his high

seat with Bishop Grimkel next him, and opposite, his marshal. Hc

thus describes his daily life: ‘It was the king’s custom to rise betimes

in the morning, put on his clothes, wash his hands, and then go to

church and hear matins and morning mass. After this he went to the
l
l

Thing to bring people to agreement with each other, or to talk of any
other matter that appeared to him needful. He invited to him men of
the best capacity, whether great or small. He often made them recite
3 to him the laws which Hacon, Athelstan's foster-son, had made for
Trondhjem3 and after considering them with those men of understanding,
he ordered laws‚ adding to or taking from those established before, as
he judged best. Christian law he settled according to the advice of ε
Bishop Grimkel and other learned clerks, and lent his whole mind to'⁸
uprooting heathenism and old customs which he thought contrary to
Chdstianity¹.’ The mode in which he sought to effect this was one
prime cause of his ultimate fate. A recent convert to Christianity, no
sooner was he firm on the throne than he set to work, very much
in the same fashion as Olaf Tryggvason, the previous king of Norway‚
to force the new faith on his subjecta
V. But it is worth while to compare the method pursued by
the two Olafs, and the results in each case. Olaf Tryggvason went
to work with considerable craft. On his arrival in any district for
the purpose of introducing Christianity, he first tried to win over the
powerful chiefs by the promise of fiefs and other advantages. The
peasants he dealt with differently, wherever he felt he could do so with
safety. ‘Be baptized or fightl’ That was the alternative he offered
them. This was forcing men into Christianity, ‘brjota menn til kristnis’
in the usual phrase of the Sagas3 a method of procedure which seems
to have been regarded with general satisfaction. Thiodrik Munk makes
the matter plain: ‘Olaf (Tryggvason), seeing that the hearts of the
people were hardened, and idolatry and the worship of demons had
been imbibedby them with their mothers‘ milk; being aware too that
nothing but the strong hand would avail, words being of none effect,
resorted to blows. Herein he imitated his Master, who poured wine
